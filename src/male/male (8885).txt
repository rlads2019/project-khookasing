Don't go changing to cry and please meYou never let me down beforeDon't imagine you're too familiarAnd I don't see you anymoreI wouldn't leave you in times of troubleWe never could have come this farI took the good times, I'll take the bad timesI'll take you just the way you areDon't go trying some new fushionDon't change the color of your hairYou always have my unspoken passionAlthought I might not seem to care I don't want clever conversationI never want to work that hardI just want someone that I can talk toI want you just the way you areI need to know that you will always beThe same old someone that I knewWhat will it take till you believe in meThe way that I believe in youI said I love you and that's foreverAnd this I promise from the heartI could hot love you any betterI love you just the way you are
