I'm on my own riding the train from home townI was a past from day to nightI going down taking a long long rideMoment of views outside my windowHow long has it gone?The train is getting far from home When the sun fade away behind the nightI feel so high but I don't know whyThe dark midnight comes to my sightThough the train may pass million miles awayI feel right up the town that I leftIs time to begin for tomorrow?
