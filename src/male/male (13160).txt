On the first of December I was commissioned to sall awayOn a ship that was sinking Forty nights and forty daysAnd while I went under The tears of a murdered landWere turning the earth info sand I'm too cold to be sleepingSo I light up a candle of regret To burn the secrets I'm keepingAnd pray that someday I can forget The cries of my peopleThe voices of doubt inside my head I think of the things that you saidAm I alone here？Are there others like me tooSafe in my capsule Unable to move？How long has it been now？And where will this journey end? Will it end...Ohhh.Got the hands of a farmer The worlds of a preacher's tongurGot the heart of a sailor To believe till your work is doneI will stand in the ocean with these wooden planks under my feetI will come to your table After my journey's complete I believe in the futureI can feel the blood rising in my veins It's the sound of a battlecryWhen only the echo remains I will serve you forever I will build youa nation of loveI'm relying on luck,oh God The four-leaf clover from a doveAnd isn't it crazy For me to start life brand new？And when I find Ararat The first thing that I'll be singing a lovesongFor my,mydear dear wife And nap in that sweet sunlight Before the nightis overI'll be crying on your shoulder My wild imagination Is keeping me fromlosing patienceWhy did you make us Only to tear us away？Why have you chosen me？It was your fault anyway...
