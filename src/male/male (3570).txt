This magic moment　So precious so rareLike no other moment　The moment we shareWhen the sun don't shine　There's nothing in my mindYou are the sweet memories　As sweet as wineMagic magic　Magic magic　And when it really happenedIt took me by surpriseI know that you feel it tooBy looking in your eyes (whenever I look in your eyes)I know that you feel it tooJust can't believe　It is trueThis magic moment　So different and so newLike no other moment　This magic moment
