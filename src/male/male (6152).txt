Whenever I'm wearyFrom the battles that raged in my headYou made sense of madnessWhen my sanity hangs by a threadI lose my way, but still youSeem to understandNow and Forever,I will be your manSometimes I just hold youToo caught up in me to seeI'm holding a fortuneThat Heaven has given to meI'll try to show youEach and every way I canNow and Forever, I will be your manNow I can rest my worriesAnd always be sureThat I won't be alone, anymoreIf I'd only known you were thereAll the time,All this time.....Until the day the oceanDoesn't touch the sandNow and ForeverI will be your manNow and Forever,I will be your man..
