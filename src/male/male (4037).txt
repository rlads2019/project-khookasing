Still I'd look To find a reason to believeSomeone like you makes it hard to liveWithout somebody elseSomeone like you make it easy to giveNever thinking of myselfIf you took the time to change my mind I could find a way To leave the past behindKnowing that you lied straight face While I criedIf I listen long enough to youI'd find the way to believe that it's all trueKnowing that you lied straight face While I criedStill I'd look To find a reason to believeStill I'd look To find a reason to believe
