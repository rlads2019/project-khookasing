So true, funny how it seemsAlways in time , but never in line for dreamsHead over heels, when toe to toeThis is the sound of my soulThis is the soundI found a ticket to the worldBut now I've come back againWhy do I find it hard to write the next lineOh, I want the truth to be saidHa,ha,ha,haI know this much is true Ha,ha,ha,haI know this much is true(baby it's so true)With a thrill in my headAnd a pill on my tongueThis for the nerves that've just begunListening to Marvin(all night long)This is the sound of my soulThis is the soundAlways slipping from my handsSigns the time of its ownTake your seaside arms and write the next lineOh, I want the truth to be know
