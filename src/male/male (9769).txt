Can you feel a rumblingIt's building up like thunder inside youFeel the earth is quakingThe air itself is shaking around youShadows on the moonSomeone's coming very soon you will meet himThe midnight rider comes for youNow is the time, you know it's rightIt is your destinyAnd there'll be no more turning backSo take your place in historyWhen he ride, ride, rides across the sky You know that something has got to changeWhen he ride, ride, rides out of the nightDon't be afraid when he comes calling your nameWhen he ride, ride, rides into your lifeYou know that nothing will be the sameDon't try to hide, you can't escape the fate he brings to youMidnight rider, midnight riderYou know what it means nowYou've always had a dream you've been afterStill you can't believe itYour dreams are all beginning to happenOver the horizonNo need to be surprised when you see himThe midnight rider comes for you
