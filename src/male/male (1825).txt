Think of yesterday and I was sighOh... Didn't try to find anythingThink of new beginnings and I can't laughOh... Is that illusion of mine?Never say I'm throughNo... Don't make me stand in the rainNow I know I won't cryCan anyone hear me out there?I don't think that it's too lateI will be moving like the wind, the windWoo... Nothing can hurt me anymore
