I took a walk around the yardI dug the flowers till it got too hardSmoked my first pack of cigarettes todayThen I, I went down, down to Lucy's old cafe I put a halfa case awayTook a sleeping pill and I tried to watch TVBut you know baby, the leading ladyLooked too much like you for the likes of me And I wokeup crying in my sleepI was talking to your pillowAnd I reached out to touch your handI knocked the phone off the night standAnd the operator said, ' Can I help you please？'And I said ' No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me.'You see I just had a bad dreamThat's all that's wrong with meYou see I just had a bad dreamWent out to loosen up the car Somehow I wound up at the Rainbow BarI had a scotch and soda on the runBut didn't get too far Then I, I ran down, down some friendsI used to knowI dragged them out to see the showI ran myself a bath and I tried to read your book But youknow baby,this time it just didn't seem Worth all the timeit lookAnd I woke up crying in my sleepI was talking to your pillowAnd I reached out to touch your handI knocked the phone off the night standAnd the operator said, ' Can I help you please？'And I said'No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me.'You see I just had a bad dreamThat's all that's wrong with meYou see I just had a bad dream
