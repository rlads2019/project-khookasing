On and on this rain will fall.Like tears from a star.Like tears from a star. On and on this rain will say.How fragile we are.How fragile we are.On and on this rain will fall.Like tears from a star.Like tears from a star.On and on this rain will say.How fragile we are.How fragile we are.How fragile we are.How fragile we are.
