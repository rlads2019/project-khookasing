Outside the rain begins and it may never endSo cry no more on the shoreA dream will take us out to sea forever more, forever moreClose your eyes, and dream, and you can be with meNeath the waves, through the caves of hoursLong forgotten now, we're all alone, we're all aloneClose the window, calm the light and it will be all rightNo need to bother now　Let it out, let it all beginLearn how to pretendOnce a story's told it can't help but grow oldRoses do lovers too　So cast your seasons to the windAnd hold me dear, oh, hold me dearClose the window, calm the light and it will be all rightNo need to bother now, let it out, let it all beginAll's forgotten now, my love, we're all alone, we're all alone
