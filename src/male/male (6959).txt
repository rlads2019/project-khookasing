One day in your lifeYou'll remember a placeSomeone touching your faceYou'll come backAnd you'll look around youOne day in your lifeYou'll remember the love you foundThen you'll remember me somehowThough you don't need me nowI will stay in your heartAnd when things fall apartYou'll remember one dayOne day in your lifeWhen you'll find that You're always waiting forA love we used to shareJust call my name and I'll be thereYou'll remember me somehowThough you don't need me nowI will stay in your heartAnd when things fall apartYou'll remember one dayOne day in your lifeWhen you find thatYou're always lonelyFor a love we used to shareJust call my name and I'll be there
