A long long time agoI can still rememberHow that music used to make me smileAnd I knew if I had my chanceThat I could make those people danceAnd maybe they'd be happy for a whileDid you write the book of loveAnd do you have faith in God aboveIf the Bible tells you so?Now do you believe in rock and roll?And Can music save your mortal soul?And can you teach me how to dance real slow?Well, I know that you're in love with him'cause I saw you dancing in the gymYou both kicked off your shoesMan, I dig those rhythm and bluesI was a lonely teenage broncin' buckWith a pink carnation and a pickup truckBut I knew I was out of luckThe day the music diedI started singing(*)Now, for ten years we've been on our ownAnd moss grows fat on a rolling stoneBut that's not how it used to beWhen the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James DeanAnd a voice that came from you and meOh and while the king was looking downThe jester stole his thorny crownThe courtroom was adjournedNo verdict was returnedAnd while Lenin read a book on MarxThe quartet practiced in the parkAnd we sang dirges in the darkThe day the music diedWe were singing(*)I met a girl who sang the bluesAnd I asked her for some happy newsBut she just smiled and turned awayI went down to the sacred storeWhere I'd heard the music years beforeBut the man there said the music wouldn't playAnd in the streets the children screamedThe lovers cried, and the poets dreamedBut not a word was spokenThe church bells all were brokenAnd the three men I admire mostthe Father, Son, and the Holy GhostThey caught the last train for the coastThe day the music diedAnd they were singing(*)
