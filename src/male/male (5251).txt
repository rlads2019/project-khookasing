The water is wide and I can't cross overNeither have I wings to flyBuild me a boat that can carry twoAnd both shall row my love and IThere is a ship and it sails on the seaShe is loaded deep as deep can beBut not as deep as the love I'm inI know not how I sink or swim Oh love is handsome, love is kindLove is a flower when first it's newBut love grows old and wax is coldAnd fades away like morning dewThe water is wide and I can't cross overNeither have I wings to flyBuild me a boat that can carry twoAnd both shall row my love and IAnd both shall row my love and I
