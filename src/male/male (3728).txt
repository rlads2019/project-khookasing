She's gone,Out of my life.I was wrong,I'm to blame,I was so untrue.I can't live without her love.Come backinto my arms.I'm so alone,I'm begging you,I'm down on my knees.Forgive me, girl. Lady, won't you save me?My heart belongs to you.Lady, can you forgive me?For all I've done to you.Lady, oh, lady.Lady, won't you save me?My heart belongs to you.Lady, can you forgive me?For all I've done to you.Lady, oh, lady.My heart belongs to you.Lady, can you forgive me?For all I've done to you.
