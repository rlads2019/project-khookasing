The whispers in the morningof lovers sleeping tight.Are rolling like thunder nowas I look in your eyes.I hold on to your bodyand feel each move you make.Your voice is warm and tenderA love that I could not forsake.Cause you are my ladyand I am your man.Whenever you reach for meI'll do all that I can.Lost is how I'm feelinglying in your arms.When the world outside's too much to take.That all ends when I'm with you.Even though there may be timesit seems I'm far away.Never wonder where I amcause I am always by your side.Cause you are my lady And I am your man.Whenever you reach for meI'll do all that I can.We're heading for somethingSomewhere I've never been.Sometimes I am frightened butI'm ready to learnof the power of love.The sound of your heart beating.Made it clear suddenly.The feeling that I can't go onis light years away.Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my man.Whenever you reach for meI'll do all that I can.We're heading for somethingSomewhere I've never been.Sometimes I am frightened butI'm ready to learnof the power of love.
