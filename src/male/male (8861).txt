Your hair is in place dressing to killYour old man has said that when he diesHe will leave you his moneyAnd the pool where you swimAre you looking for somethingMaybe you ain't gettin' from himSteppin' out, steppin' outTo get a little action on the sideSteppin' out, steppin' outThe day time queen takes a midnight rideAnd it's plain as plain could be You're a woman who wants to be freeSo if you're steppin' out tonight honeyCome on and step out with meThe party's a bore, it's bound to get worseLet's slip out somewhere and engageIn our own celebrationLet me pour you some wineAre you thinking maybe babyYour needs are the same as mineLet's go for a walk, go for a rideOr maybe just stand here and thinkWhat we can do to eachotherNo we don't have to danceIf you're thinking of stepping outHoney this is your chance
