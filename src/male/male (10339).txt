I can think of younger days when living for my lifeWas everything a man could want to doI could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrowAnd how can you mend a broken heartHow can you stop the rain from falling downHow can you stop the sun from shiningWhat makes the world go roundHow can you mend this broken manHow can a loser ever winPlease help me mend my broken heart and let me live againI can still feel the breeze that rustles through the treesAnd misty memories of days gone by We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrowAnd how can you mend a broken heartHow can you stop the rain from falling downHow can you stop the sun from shiningWhat makes the world go roundHow can you mend this broken manHow can a loser ever winPlease help me mend my broken heart and let me live againHow can you mend this broken manHow can a loser ever winPlease help me mend my broken heart and let me live againAnd let me live again
