When the twilight is goneAnd no songbirds are singingWhen the twilight is goneYou come into my heartAnd here in my heart you will stayWhile I prayMy prayer is to linger with youAt the end of the dayIn a dream that's divine My prayer is a rapture in blueWith the world far awayAnd your lips close to mineTonight while our hearts are aglowOh tell me the words that I longing to knowMy prayer and the answer you giveMay they still be the same for as long as we liveThat you always be there at the end of my prayer
