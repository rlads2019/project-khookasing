You've got the best of both worldsYou're the kind of girl who can take down a manAnd lift him back up againYou are strong but you're needyHumble but you're greedyBased on your body languageyour shouted cursive I've been readingYou're style is quite selectivethough your mind is rather recklessWell I guess it just suggeststhat this is just what happiness isHey, what a beautiful mess this isIt's like picking up trash in dressesWell it kind of hurts when the kind of words you writeKind of turn themselves into knivesAnd don't mind my nerve you could call it fictionBut I like being submerged in your contradictions dear'Cause here we are, here we areAlthough you were biased I love your adviceYour comebacks they're quickAnd probably have to do with your insecurities There's no shame in being crazy,Depending on how you take theseWords that paraphrasing this relationship we're stagingAnd it's a beautiful mess, yes it isIt's like, we are picking up trash in dressesWell it kind of hurts when the kind of words you sayKind of turn themselves into bladesAnd the kind and courteous is a life I've heardBut it's nice to say that we played in the dirt, oh dearCause herewe are, here we areHere we are....We're still hereAnd it's a beautiful mess, yes it isIt's like taking a guess when the only answer is yesAnd through timeless words and priceless picturesWe'll fly like birds out of this earthAnd tides they turn and hearts disfigureBut that's no concern when we're wounded togetherAnd we tore our dresses and stained our shirtsBut its nice today, oh the wait was so worth it
