Don't let the sun catch you cryingThe night's the time for all your tearsYour heart may be broken tonightBut tomorrow with the morning lightDon't let the sun catch you cryingThe night time shadows disappearAnd with them go all your tearsOh the morning will bring joy to every girl and boySo, don't let the sun catch you cryingWe know that crying's not a bad thingBut stop your crying when the birds singIt may be hard to discoverthat you've been left for anotherso don't forget that love's a gameand it can always come and go againSo, Don't Let the Sun Catch You CryingDon't Let the Sun Catch You CryingOh no, oh no
