Oh, It's time to dream , a thousand dreams of you !It's been so grand together, yes , together .You thrilled me from the start .You brought the spring again .Your fingers touched the strings of my heartand made it sing again .I hope you dream a thousand dreams of me .All things we're planed doing together .And if you do, I dream my whole life through .A thousand , a million , a zillion dreams of you !
