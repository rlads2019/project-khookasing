Saying 'I Love You' is not the wordsI want to hear from you.It's not that I want you not to sayBut if you only knew how easy it would beto show me how you feelMore than words is all you have to doTo make it realThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me'Cause I'd already knowWhat would you do if my heart was turn in twoMore than wordsTo show you feel that your love for me is realWhat would you say if I took those words awayThen you couldn't make things new Just by saying I Love YouLa...More than words.La...Now that I've tried toTalk to you And make you understandOr you have to do is close your eyes andJust reach our your hands and touch me hold me close.Don't ever let me goMore than words is all that ever needed you to showThen you woudln't have to say that you love me'Cause I'd already knowWu......More than Words.
