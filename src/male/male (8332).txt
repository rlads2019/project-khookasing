When you're lost and the light is fadingThe wind blows cold and you can't find your way back homeRemember that the darkest hour is just before the dawnSometimes a leap of fauth is all it takesCause only love can see the path to set you freeJust close your eyes, look inside, and let your heart believeThere's been a force so strong beside you all alongYou'll know it when your dream comes trueThere's something only love can do In your quest for a new horizonSet your course find a star to light your wayAlthough the task may seen sometimes to be more than you can bearOne thing you need to know you are not aloneIf you believe in miracles then you can be the oneTo shine you light and show the worldThere's nothing love can't overcomeThere's something only love can do
