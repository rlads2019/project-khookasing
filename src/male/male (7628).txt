There's a girl on my mindAnd she knows I'm thinking of herOn my way through the day and the nightThe stars shine above meShe's been gone for some timeBut I know I truly love herAnd I'm singing the songHoping she'll be back when she hears itMy heart go sha la la la laSha la la in the morningWoo～ sha la la la laSha la la in the sunshineMy heart go sha la la la laSha la la in the evening Woo～ sha la la la laSha la la la la just for youIf your love's gone away just like mineYou feel like cryingSing along may be once may be twiceJust try it togethersome sweet days no one knows she will returnAnd you'll be happyShadows fade in the sunListen to your heart it is singingYeah～ sha la la la laSha la la la la
