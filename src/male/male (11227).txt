You ask me if I love youAnd I choke on my replyI'd rather hurt you honestly than mistead you with a lieAnd who am I to judge you on what you say or doI'm only just beginning yo see the real youAnd sometimes when we touchThe honestly too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesRomance and all its strategyLesves me batting with my prideBut thur the insecurity some tenderness survivesI'm just anther writer still trapped within my trutha hesitant prizfighters still trapped within my youth At time I'd like to break youAnd drive you to your kneesAt times I'd like to break thurAnd hold you endlesslyAt times I understand youI know how hard you tryI've watched while love commands youAnd I've watched love pass you byAt times I think we're driftersStill searching for a friend a brother or a sisterBut then the passion flares againAnd some times when we touch the honestly too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you till I dieTill We both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
