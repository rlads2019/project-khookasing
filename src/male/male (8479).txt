Even though we ain't got moneyI'm so in love with you honeyEverything will bring a chain of loveIn the morning when I riseBring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell meEverything's gonna be all rightLove a girl who holds the world in a paper cupDrink it up, love her and she'll bring you luckIf you find she helps your mind, better take her homeOh dontcha live alone, try to earn what lovers own Even though we ain't got moneyI'm so in love with you honeyEverything will bring a chain of loveIn the morning when I riseBring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell meEverything's gonna be all rightEven though we ain't got moneyI'm so in love with you honeyEverything will bring a chain of loveIn the morning when I riseBring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell meEverything's gonna be all right
