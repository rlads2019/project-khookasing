And there's a bird in the sky looking right at usSeeing the footsteps we each takeAs we're closer to meet at onceAnd there's a bird on the treeSinging right at usAs you walk inThe coffee shopThat's the day we first metChorusSo I say come out your wayCome out your way with meThere's no regret, there's no returnAll I need is youSo baby come out your wayCome out your way with meI love you so, I love you soYou just have to walk through that doorAnd there's a bird in the nest crying just like usOur love has been through some ups and downsSometimes we just need a breathAnd there's a bird in the air laughing just like us With you I know, you are my oneI'll hold you in my heartChorusSo I say come out your wayCome out your way with meThere's no regret, there's no returnAll I need is youSo baby come out your wayCome out your way with meI love you so, I love you soYou just have to walk through that doorWith you I know, you are my oneI'll hold you in my heartSo I say come out your wayCome out your way with meThere's no regret, there's no returnAll I need is youSo baby come out your wayCome out your way with meI love you so, I love you soYou just have to walk through that door
