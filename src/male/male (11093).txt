You're the one who set it up now you're the one to make it stopI'm the one who's feeling lost right nowNow you want me to forget every little thing you saidbut there is something left in my headChorus:I won't forget the way you're kissingThe feeling's so strong were lasting for so longBut I'm not the man your heart is missingThat's why you go away I knowYou were never satisfied no matter how I triedNow you wanna say goodbye to meLove is one big illusion I should try to forgetbut there is something left in my head Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissingThe feeling's so strong were lasting for so longBut I'm not the man your heart is missingThat's why you go away I knowSitting here all alone in the middle of nowhereDon't know which way to goThere ain't so much to say now between usThere ain't so much for youThere ain't so much for me anymoreChorus:I won't forget the way you're kissingThe feeling's so strong were lasting for so longBut I'm not the man your heart is missingThat's why you go away I knowThat's why you go away I know
