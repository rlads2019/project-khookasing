Lazy days in mid July. Country Sunday mornings.Dusty haze on summer highways. Sweet magnolia calling.Now and then I find myself thinking of the days when we were walking in the Alabama rain.Drivin' movies Friday nights, drinkin' beers & laughin'.Somehow things will always right. Just don't know what happened.Now and then I find myself thinking of the days when we were walking in the Alabama rain.We were only kids but then I never heard it said that kiss can falling in love and feel the same.I can still remember the first time I told you I love you.All the dust in mid July. Country summer's evening.Weeping willow sang its lullaby share our secret.Now and then I find myself thinking of the days when we were walking in the Alabama rain.Walking in the Alabama rain.
