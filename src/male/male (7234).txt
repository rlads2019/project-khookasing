When you body's had enough of me andI'm laying flat out on the floorWhen you think I've loved you all I canI'm golla love you a little bit moreCome on over and lay by my sideI've got to be touching youLet me rub your tired shouldersThe way I used to doLook in to my eyes, and gives me that smileThe ont that always turns me on And let me take your hair down'cuase we're standing up to great the sunGot to say a few things, that have been in my mindAnd you know where my mind has beenI guess I learned my lessonsAnd now's the time to beginSo if you're feeling alright and you're ready for meI know that I'm ready for youWe'd better get it on now'cause we got to a whole life to live through
