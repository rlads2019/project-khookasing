Cause the way I feel tonightEverything will be alrightI will keep your candle burningOh yes the way I feel tonightEverything will be alrightAnd the way I feel tonight,I love you Close the door and turn the keyOpen up your heart to meI can see your love light glowingLet your body melt to mineLet us taste each other's wineTill the cup is overflowingCause the way I feel tonightEverything will be alrightI will keep your candle burningOh yes the way I feel tonightEverything will be alrightAnd the way I feel tonight,I love you
