I'm not asking you to changeWho you are, where you're goingI'm not asking you to lose.... controlI'm not asking for the world　Or you to keep it spinningJust that you'll be the one receivingAll this lovin' that I'm giving(Chorus)All I ask is that you love me　In my own special wayYet that I'm the one who holds youWhere there's nothing left to sayAll I ask is that you need me　More than anybody elseThat you're there for me to turn toWhen I'm lost myself　All I ask of you, all I ask of youIs that you love me　When I think of all the thingsWe will do when we're together　Say a little prayer for loveI won't take up all your timeJust give me all your precious moments　Baby open your armsLet me fill them with emotion (Chorus)All I ask is that you love me　In my own special wayYet that I'm the one who holds you　Where there's nothing left to sayAll I ask is that you need me　More than anybody elseThat you're there for me to turn to　When I'm lost myselfAll I ask of you, all I ask of you　Is that you love meThat you love me　I believe, I believe, I believeYou were meant for me　Let you be, let you breathe, let you fly'Cos you come right back to meYou come right back to me baby(Chorus)All I ask is that you love me　In my own special wayYet that I'm the one who holds you　Where there's nothing left to sayAll I ask is that you need me　More than anybody elseThat you're there for me to turn to　When I'm lost myselfAll I ask of you, all I ask of you　Is that you love meThat you love me　Tell me　Do you love me?Do you love me?
