Listen to the rhythm of the falling rainTelling me just what a fool I've beenI wish that it would go and let me cry in vainAnd let me be alone againThe only girl I care about has gone awayLooking for a brand new startBut little does she know that when she left that dayAlong with her she took my heartRain, please tell me, now, does that seem fairFor her to steal my heart away when she don't care?I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far awayThe only girl I care about has gone awayLooking for a brand new start But little does she know that when she left that dayAlong with her she took my heartRain, won't you tell her that I love her so?Please, ask the sun to set her heart aglowRain in her heart and let the love we knew start to growListen to the rhythm of the falling rainTelling me just what a fool I've beenI wish that it would go and let me cry in vainAnd let me be alone againOh, listen to the falling rainPitter-patter, pitter-patterOh, listen, listen to the falling rainPitter-patter, pitter-patterOh, listen (listen) to the falling rain
