I'm singing in the rainJust singing in the rainWhat a glorious feelingI'm happy againI'm laughing at cloudsSo dark up aboveThe sun's in my heartAnd I'm ready for loveFor loveLet the stormy clouds chaseEveryone from the placeCome on with the rainI've a smile on my faceI'll walk down the laneWith a happy refrain Singing, singing in the rainIn the rainI'm singing in the rainJust singing in the rainWhat a glorious feelingI've a smile on my faceI walk down the laneWith a happy refrainI'm singing, singing in the rainIn the rainIn the rainIn the rain
