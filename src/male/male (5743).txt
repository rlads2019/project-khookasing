You made up your mindIt was time it was overAfter we've had come so farBut I think there's enoughPieces of forgivenessSomewhere in my broken heartI would not have chosenThe road you have takenIt has left us miles apartBut I think I can still findThe will to keep goingSomewhere in my broken heart So fly Go ahead and flyTill you find out who you areAnd I, I will keep my love unspokenSomewhere in my broken heartI hope that in time you will findWhat you long for loveThat's written in the starsWhen you finally leaveI think you will see itSomewhere in my broken heart(Somewhere in my broken heart)
