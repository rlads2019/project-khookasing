Fly me to the moonAnd let me play among the stars,Let me see you what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.In other words, hold my hand.In other words, baby, kiss me* Fill my heart with songAnd let me sing forever more You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.In other words, please be true.In other words, I love you *Repeat *
