WellI can't forget this eveningAnd your face when you were leavingBut I guess that's just the way the story goesYou always smileBut in your eyes your sorrow showsYes, it showsWell, I think forget tomorrowI had you there,then I let you go And now it's only fair thatI should let you know what you should knowI can't liveIf living is without youI can't giveI can't give anymoreI can't liveIf living is without youI can't giveI can't give anymore
