Why is my heartso bothered by the spring windIt's a mystery I can't explainCold cold nightRain drops in black and whiteLooking back it feels like a dreamThe picture remains caught in a frameHow, how can I get throughFind a way to see through yesterday's bluesCos I, I could never see you like how others see youAs Yesterday's News啊　不怕相思苦　只怕妳傷痛怨只怨人在風中　聚散都不由我Cos I, I could never see youlike how others see youAs Yesterday's News
