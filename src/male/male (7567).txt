Are you going to Scarborough Fair?Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.Remember me to one who lives there,He once was the true love of mine.Tell him to make me a cambric shirt.Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.Without no seams nor needlework.Then he'll be a true love of mine.Tell him to find me an acre of land.Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Between salt water and the sea strand.Then he'll be a true love of mine.Tell him to reap it in a sickle of leather.Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.And gather it all in a bunch of heather.Then he'll be a true love of mine.Are you going to Scarborough Fair?Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.Remember me to one who lives there,He once was the true love of mine.
