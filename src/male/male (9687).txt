You must remember thisA kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.The fundamental things applyAs time goes by.And when two lovers wooThey still say, 'I love you.'On that you can relyNo matter what the future bringsAs time goes by.Moonlight and love songsNever out of date.Hearts full of passionJealousy and hate.Woman needs manAnd man must have his mateThat no one can deny.It's still the same old storyA fight for love and gloryA case of do or die The world will always welcome loversAs time goes by.And when two lovers wooThey still say, 'I love you.'On that you can relyNo matter what the future bringsAs time goes by.Moonlight and love songsNever out of date.Hearts full of passionJealousy and hate.Woman needs manAnd man must have his mateThat no one can deny.It's still the same old storyA fight for love and gloryA case of do or dieThe world will always welcome loversAs time goes by.
