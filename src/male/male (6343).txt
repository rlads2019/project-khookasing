Jingle bells jingle bellsJingle all the wayOh what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh HeyJingle bells jingle bellsJingle all the wayOh what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh HeyDashing through the snowIn a one-horse open sleighO'er the fields we goLaughing all the wayBells on bobtail ring Making spirits brightWhat fun it is to ride and singA sleighing song tonight OhJingle bells,jingle bellsJingle all the wayOh what fun it is to ride,In a one-horse open sleigh HeyJingle bells jingle bellsJingle all the wayOh what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleighOh what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh
