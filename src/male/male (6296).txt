Don't go breaking my heartI couldn't if I triedOh honey if I get restlessBaby you're not that kindDon't go breaking my heartYou take the weight off meOh honey when you knock on my doorI gave you my keyNobody knows itWhen I was downI was your clownNobody knows it Nobody knowsRight from the startI gave you my heart Ohï½ž I gave you my heartSo don't go breaking my heartI won't go breaking your heartDon't go breaking my heartAnd nobody told us'Cause nobody showed usAnd now it's up to us girlI think we can make itSo don't misunderstand meYou put the light in my lifeYou put the sparks to the flameI've got your heart in my sights
