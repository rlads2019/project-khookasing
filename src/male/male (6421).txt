黑暗裡 月亮落了地應該悲傷嘆息 身體卻沒了力氣因為彼此懷疑 我們漂浮在這裡我們曾有引力 怎麼沒人記起Stay hereI want you stay with me用盡最後的空氣Stay hereI want you stay with me反正也沒人回應Stay here Stay StayStay Stay Stay Stay Stay StayStay hereI want you stay with me在聽不見的夜裡 Stay hereI want you stay with me像沒人看的電影看 天空再閃來的太晚Stay here stay with me就這樣漫無目的Stay here stay with me像墜入最深的海底Stay hereI want you stay with me向著稀薄的光明Stay hereI want you stay with me換個清白的姓名 再叫醒
