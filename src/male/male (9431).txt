The truth is tearing up my heartI can't recognize this placeThe endless road without a stop signCan't even find a stranger this time＊Why am I still holding back my tears　In this loneliness there's nothing to fear　Every chord still seems a wonder　How we could be together　Every time I ask if this would be the last＃Why am I still talking to myself　Hopin' you will have the keys to my cell　Every song might calm the weather　But it just draws me deeper　How do I get out of this, I think　I never will... A crystal forming in the eyeMaybe this would be the lastA winding path down my faceTill I begin to taste the bitterness insideRepeat ＊＃Why am I still holding back my tearsIn this loneliness there's nothing left to fearEvery chord still seems a wonderHow we could be togetherEvery time I ask if this would be the lastRepeat ＃I never will...
