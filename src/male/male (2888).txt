when i was youngI never needed anyoneAnd makin love was just for funThose days are goneLivin aloneI think of all the friends I've knownBut when I dial the telephoneNobaby's homeAll by myself Don't wanna be all by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna live all by myself anymoreHard to be sureSometimes I feel so insecureAnd love so distant and obscureRemains the cureOP:Campbell Connelly & Co., Ltd.SP:BMG Music Publishing SE Asia Ltd.
