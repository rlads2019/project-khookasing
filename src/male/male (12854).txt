When I look up to the skiesGreet the sight before my eyesAnd I welcome yet another glorious dayEvery morning's bright sunriseNever ceases to surpriseWith the possibilities it brings my waySo into my life I goKnowing everything I knowHoping every moment in my day stays brightAs I follow my life's flowI will carry on to growJust as long as life can let my dreams take flightAnd as long as I believe what I believeI can be all that I know all I can beIf I just allowLove to lead the way, no matter howI'll do my best, as I'm prepared to tryAnd I know if I believe what I believeI will know that somehow I will be set freeFrom all that's in the wayIt won't matter what they say I'll do everything it takesWith the strength so that I mayLet my passion flyThis is what I've always knownI can't reach the skies aloneSo I'll reach out to the ones who care for meTill I know that I have grownTill I'm standing on my ownWith the love that leads me to my destinyAnd as long as I believe what I believeI can be all that I know all I can beIf I just allowLove to lead the way, no matter howI'll do my best, as I'm prepared to tryAnd I know if I believe what I believeI will know that somehow I will be set freeFrom all that's in the wayIt won't matter what they sayI'll do everything it takesWith the strength so that I mayLet my passion fly
