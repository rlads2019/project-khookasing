Every time I look into the mirror of my mindI barely recognize the man I seeHe used to be a dreamerHe used to be like meBut I can see the sadness in his eyesAnd he's no longer who I want to beIf I could I would change my yesterdayI would listen to my heart and then todayI'd see What true love could be and I won't let tomorrowI won't let tomorrow slip awayI feel the tide is turning and I'm stranded out at sea Hoping for my rescue to arriveThe clouds have all turned greyAnd now the waves are crashing inI thought I could survive but reality has got the better part of meIf I could I would change my yesterdayI would listen to my heart and then todayI'd see What true love could be and I won't let tomorrowI won't let tomorrow Ship awayI'll make the promise to myselfThat I will live each day just like it was the last timeI'll ever see your face again
