I know just how to whisper and I know just how to cry.I know just where to find the answers and I know just how to lie.I know just how to fake it and I know just how to scheme.I know just when to face the truth and then I know just when to dream.And I know just where to touch you and I know just what to prove.I know when to pull you closer and I know when to let you loose.And I know the night is fading. And I know the time's gonna fly.And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you,But I know I've got to give it a try.And I know the roads to riches. And I know the ways to fame.I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'emAnd I always know the name of the game.But I don't know how to leave you and I'll never let you fall.And I don't know how you do it, making love out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.Everytime I see you well the rays of the sun areall streaming through the waves in your hair.And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight.The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lostand it's looking for a rhythm like you.You can take the darkness from the deep of the night,And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright.I gotta follow it cause everything I know, Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you.I can make you run or stumble. I can make the final block.And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle.And I can make all the stadiums rock.I can make tonight foreveror I can make it disappear by the dawn.And I can make you every promise that's ever been made.And I can make all your demons be gone.But I'm never gonna make it without you.Do you really wanna see me crawl?And I'm never gonna make it like you do,Making love out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.(Making love) Out of nothing at all.
