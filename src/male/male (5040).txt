Time is like a dreamAnd now for a time you are mineLet's hold fast to the dreamThat tastes and sparkles like wineWho knows if it's real or just somethingWe're both dreaming ofWhat seem like an interlude nowCould be the beginning of love Loving you is a world that's strangeSo much more than my heart can holdLoving you make the whole world changeLoving you I could not grow oldNo, nobody knowswhen love will endSo till then sweet friend(Time is like a dream)(And now for a time you are mine)(Let's hold fast to the dream)(That tastes and sparkles like wine)
