Have I told you lately that I love you?Have I told you there's no one else above youYou fill my heart with gladnessTake away all my sadnessEase my troubles that's what you doFor the morning sun and all it's gloryGreets the day with hope and comfort tooYou fill my heart with laughterAnd somehow you make it better Ease my troubles that's what you doThere's a love that's divineAnd it's your's and it's mine, like the sun, oohAnd at the end of the dayWe should give thanks and pray, to the one, to the oneYou fill my heart with laughterAnd somehow you make it betterEase my troubles that's what you do
