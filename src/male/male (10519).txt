Everyday when I think I see her ( I want to meet her )But I turn the other wayAnd all the time I wanna say something to her ( say something to her )But I wait another day ( hey )And everyday I try hard not to stare ( not that she'd care )But I'm too shy to act on a careAnd if I find that she can't be mine ( she's not my kind )Then I would be wasting my time . . .I would be wasting my timeThey all tell me just to speak my mind And let my mouth unwind　to act real gental and kindI don't think I'm ready yet to call her mineI don't think it's time　And it's easier said then doneAnd No I can't remember　And No I can't rememberAnd No I can't remember　No I can't remember my lifeAnd everyday I've got a present to give her ( present to give her )But I put the present awayAnd everyday when I think I miss her ( I want to kiss her )But I keep my distance and waitUntil a day when I've got something to sayThat will be my happiest day . . .That will be my happiest day . . .
