The highway lies between usThe things we said that we mustThe raving disillusion of the thingswe almost did but like the rocky roadthat twists and turnsWhere's endWhere is the ending of our songThe love you gave to me is so tureI hope it lasts forever dear Life is running shortDon't waste our tearsYou are the oneI'll love in all my yearsThe moment when I need youI think It's time I miss youFeelings that are reside meI know I can't live without youTake my hands and let me hold you for one more timeLet our minds fly to the ending of our time
