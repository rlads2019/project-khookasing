I've been hurtPromised myselfI would never love againThat's the endYou fill up my senses like a night in a forestLike the mountains in springtimeLike a walk in the rainLike a storm in the desertLike a sleepy blue oceanYou fill up my sensesWhen I speak with sobWhen we're finally standing face to faceCome let me love youLet me give my life to youLet me drown in your laughterLet me die in your arms (Just trying to feel real love)Let me lay down beside you Let me always be with youCome let me love youCome love me againIf do something I never wouldDoes it mean I'm not so good?What about the way I feel insideIf you want itIf you need itWe'd releaseWe'd feel safe somehowEven never we are so emotionalYou fill up me senses like a night in a forest(We will realize)Like the mountains in springtimeLike a walk in the rain(Just trying to feel real love)Like a storm in the desertLike a sleepy blue oceanYou fill up my senses come fill me again(To feel real love)You fill up my senses come fill me againTo feel real love
