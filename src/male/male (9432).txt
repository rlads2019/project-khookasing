Outside the rain begins, and it may never endSo cry no more, on the shore a dreamWill take us out to seaForever more, forever moreClose your eyes and dream, and you can be with meNeath the waves, through the caves of hoursLong forgotten nowWe're all alone, We're all aloneClose the window calm the lightAnd it will be alrightNo need to bother nowLet it out, let it all beginLearn how to pretendOnce a story's told it can't help but grow oldRoses do, lovers too, so cast your seasons to the wind And told me dear, Ohhh hold me DearClose the window calm the lightAnd ir will be all alrightNo need to bother nowLet it out, let it all beginAll's forgotten nowWe're all alone, all aloneClose the window calm the lightAnd ir will be all alrightNo need to bother nowLet it out, let it all beginOwe it to the windMy loveHold me DearAll's forgotten now my loveWe're all alone
