When I was small,and Christmas trees were tallWe used to love while others used to playDon't ask me why, but time has passed us bySome one else moved in from far awayNow we are tall,and Christmas trees are smallAnd you don't ask the time of dayBut you and I, our love will never dieBut guess we'll cry come First of MayThe apple tree that grew for you and meI watched the apples falling one by oneAnd I recall the moment of them allThe day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
