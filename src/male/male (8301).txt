For once in my lifeI have someone who needs meSomeone I've needed so longFor once unafraidI can go where life leads meAnd somehow I know I'll be strongFor once I can touchWhat my heart used to dream ofLong before I knewSomeone warm like youCould make my dreams come trueFor once in my lifeI won't let sorrow hurt meNot like it's hurt me beforeFor once I have someone I know won't desert meI'm not alone anymoreFor once I can sayThis is mine, you can't take itAs long as I know I have love I can make itFor once in my lifeI have someone who needs meFor once I can sayThis is mine, you can't take itAs long as I know I have love I can make itFor once in my lifeI've got someoneFor once in my lifeI've got someoneFor once in my lifeI've got someone, someone who needs me
