Oh It's time to dreama thousand dreams of youIt's been so grandtogether yes togetherYou thrilled me from the startYou brought the Spring againYour fingers touched the strings of my heartand made it sing again ＊I hope you dream　a thousand dreams of me　All things we've planned　doing together　(Well we promise to do something together)　And if you do　I dream my whole life through　A thousand a million　a zillion dreams of you＊REPEAT＊
