*I like dreamin'Cause dreamin' can make you mineI like dreamin'Close my eyes and feelin' fineWhen the lights go downI'm holding you so tightGotcha in my armsAnd it's paradiseTill the morning lightI see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshineWe've walked along St.Thmoas Beach a million timesHand in handTwo lovers kissin' in the sandSide by sideThe tide rolls in I'm touching you, you touching meIf only it could beThrough each dream how our love has grownI see us with our children and our happy homeLittle smileSo warm and terder lookin' up at usBless by loveThe world we share until I wakeI reach for youAnd you're just not thereI like dreamin'Cause dreamin' can make you mineI like holdin' you closeTouchin' your skinEven if it's in my mind
