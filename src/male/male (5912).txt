If I were a swan I'd be goneIf I were a train I'd be lateAnd if I were a good manI'd talk with you more often than I doIf I were asleep I could dreamIf I were afraid I could hideIf I go insanePlease don't put your wires in my brainIf I were the moon I'd be cool If I were a rule I would bendIf I were a good manI'd understand the spaces between friendsIf I were alone I would cryAnd if I were with you I'd be home and dryAnd if I go insaneWill you still let me join in with the gameIf I were a swan I'd be goneIf I were a train I'd be late againAnd if I were a good manI'd talk with you more often than I do
