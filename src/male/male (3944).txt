Well this Christmas,I am falling like snowflakes at your doorAs my guardian angel singing for someone elseEternity stings, when love has turned into painWoo 'love' must be something I don't deserveThis is my private Christmas Song All the memories are fading Snow turns to rainAs tonight, I am craving for those endless kissesA melody written for someonejust as a child has its parentsThis song is something you never care forWell This is My Private Christmas songThis is My Private Christmas Song
