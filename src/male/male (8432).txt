Carried your books from schoolPlaying make believe you're married to meYou were fifth grade I was sixth when we came to beWalking homoe everyday ever barnaca bridge and bayTill we grew into me and youWent our separate waysMy eyes adored youOh I'll never lay a hand on youMy eyes adored youLike a adored miles away from me You couldn't see how I adored youSo close so close and yet so farReady for city lightsClimbed the ladder up to forune and fameI worked my fingers to fortune and fameMade myself a nameFunny I seem to find that no matter how the years unwhineStill I reminis about the girl I missAnd the love I lef behindAll my life I will rememberHow warm and tender we were way back than oh, babyFull of feeling sad regretsI know I want never forget you my childhood friend
