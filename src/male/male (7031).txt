I can't believe it. Tell me I'm dreaming.That we are still 'we'.It was amazing Said you were luckyThat you found meIt was on a rainy day that we metYou didn't have a place to goI said we just met so lets go slow but noYou just told me to keep you from the coldSorry I can take itWhy did u fake it Why did we kissAnd I'm just downYou left me with a note without a soundI figured I must have been such a child You'll never know how much I've been aroundHow my heart just frownsIf you're downI'll be your teddy bear,I'll be your clownI'll take you round and round andIf you don't mind I could be your standing groundEven if that means I'd drownAnd baby, that'll be my one last vow
