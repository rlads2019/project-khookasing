I know it's a small changeBut coming from the heartEvery little bit becomes a lotHelping and givingFor nothing in returnI want to do my partAnd take my turnFor every kindness we showLove will come back tenfoldThat's when I started to knowThat's when my heart began to growIt's just a tiny flameBut a thousand light up the darkest nightI'm adding one more candle to the light Repeat all-Instrumental break-For every kindness we showLove will come back tenfoldThat's when I started to knowThat's when my heart began to growIt's just a tiny flameBut a thousand light up the darkest nightI'm adding one more candle to the lightThat's when I started to knowThat's when my heart began to growIt's just a tiny flameBut a thousand light up the darkest nightI'm adding one more candle to the lightI'm adding one more candle to the lightI'm adding one more candle to the light
