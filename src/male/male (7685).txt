With words unspoken, we'll bring the light of dayWith heart unbroken, we'll drive fear awayThrough love's devotion, we'll see a brighter dayOver the oceans, we'll fly your wayTake away the ngiht, never-ending dreams will be your guideShadows into light, all our hopes and prayers be by your sideDarkness behind us, wait for the morning sky Sunlight beside us, shine through your eyesThrough love's devotion, we'll see a brighter dayOver the oceans, we'll fly your wayTake away the ngiht, never-ending dreams will be your guideShadows into light, all our hopes and prayers be by your sideDarkness behind us, wait for the morning skySunlight beside us, shine through your eyesDarkness behind us, wait for the morning sky
