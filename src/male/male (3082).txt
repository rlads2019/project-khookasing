Ooh... Can I still cling to illusionsThat there'll be a solution?Ooh... Am I a fool still chasing shadowsWithout a star to followBut after all's said and doneI can't help wishing you wellI still believe time will tell If he breaks your heartIf he turns awayI'll take up the partI won't ever straySo play, blue guitarPlay that sad refrainCarry me so farTill I feel no painPlay on, blue guitarPlay that sad refrainCarry me so farTake me from the pain
