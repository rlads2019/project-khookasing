Once in every lifeSomeone comes alongAnd you came to meIt was almost like a songYou were in my armsRight where you belongAnd we were so in loveIt was almost like a songJanuary through DecemberWe had such a perfect yearThen the flame became a dying emberAll at once you weren't here Now my broken heartCries for you eachNight and it's almost like a songBut it's much too sadTo write we were so in loveIt was almost like a songNow my broken heartCries for you eachNight and It's almost like a songBut it's much too sad to writeMuch too sad to writeIt was almost like a song
