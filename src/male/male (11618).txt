And if you say this life ain't good enoughI would give my world to lift you upI could change my life to better suit your moodCause you're so smoothAnd just like the ocean under the moonWell that's the same emotion that I get from youYou got the kind of lovin' that can be so smoothGimme your heart, make it realOr else forget about itI'll tell you one thingIf you would leave it would be a crying shameIn every breath and every wordI hear your name calling me out Out from the barrioYou hear my rhythm from your radioYou feel the turning of the world so soft and slowTurning you round and roundAnd if you say this life ain't good enoughI would give my world to lift you upI could change my life to better suit your moodCause you're so smoothAnd just like the ocean under the moonWell that's the same emotion that I get from youYou got the kind of lovin' that can be so smoothGimme your heart, make it realOr else forget about itAnd just like the ocean under the moonWell that's the same emotion that I get from youYou got the kind of lovin' that can be so smoothGimme your heart, make it realOr else forget about it
