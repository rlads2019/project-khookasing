I just want you in my dreamMaybe you never want to think about me我和你一樣不安靜　愛讓人看不清　我不想失去你I just want you in my lifeMaybe you never want to think about me在夜裡拚命尋著你　都沒人看見你　我越來越想你 Something's coming Yeah我愛的不輕　睜不開眼睛　忘不了的你Something's coming Yeah我愛的不輕　If I don't see you anymore　I Love You still我愛你　Baby I love youLet me talk to youLet me hold you, love you
