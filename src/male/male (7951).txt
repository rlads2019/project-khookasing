When the time gets near for me to show my loveThe longer I stayed away forhiding from a word I need to bear nowDon't think I'll hear it againBut the nights were always warm with youHolding you right by my sideBut the morning always comes too soonBefore I even close my eyesAll I do each night is prayHoping that I'll be a part of you again some dayAll I do each night is think Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love withinIf you can't forgive the pastI'll understand thatCan't understand why I did this to youAnd all of the days and the nights so I'll regret itI never showed you my loveSurely we must be in sightOf the dream we long to be liveOf you stop and close your eyesYou'll picture me insideI'm so cold and all alone
