Who's gonna tell you whenIt's too lateWho's gonna tell you thingsAren't so greatYou can't go onThinking nothing's wrongWho's gonna drive you home tonightWho's gonna pick you upWhen you fallWho's gonna hang it upWhen you callWho's gonna pay attentionTo your dreamsWho's gonna plug their earsWhen you scream You can't go onThinking nothing's wrongWho's gonna drive you home tonightWho's gonna hold you downWhen you shakeWho's gonna come aroundWhen you breakYou can't go onThinking nothing's wrongWho's gonna drive you home tonightYou know you you can't go onThinking nothing's wrongWho's gonna drive you home tonight
