When you can't find the wayEvery single dream will still remainThough endless space and timeThrough all the tears and the painYou never lose your pride of placeYou sing out with joy and with graceWith nothing lost and all the world to gainThrough all the wind and the rainThe sun will surely shine againWe believe in what you sayIt is only a heartbeat wayNot a doubt along the wayThere's not a moment to wasteFor in your heart, the path remains the sameShow us the innocenceThe confidence, the strength to see you through Only to be the bestYou'll never restUntil your dreams come trueTo be invincible, to be unbeatableThen you begin to tell the greatest story ever toldTo reach the pinnacle, nothing's unreachableNothing's impossible if you believe in miraclesShow us the innocenceThe confidence, the strength to see you throughOnly to be the bestYou'll never restUntil your dreams come trueTo be invincible, to be unbeatableThen you begin to tell the greatest story ever toldTo reach the pinnacle, nothing's unreachableNothing's impossible if you believe in miracles
