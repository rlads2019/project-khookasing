Well I search for her in every townOn every city streetBut I, I just can't findThe one for meAnd I look for her in every crowdAsk everyone I meetOh where, where in the worldCan she beAlthough my heart keeps telling meYou'll find her, wait and seeI'm as lonely as can beTill I hold her in my arms Say 'I love you'Tell me how long must I keepHolding on to a dreamWhere is the ladyWhere is the ladyMeant for meAs I watch the lonely days go byIt's hard to carry onNo I, I just can't findThe love I needAs I face another empty nightSeems all my hope is goneOh where, where in the worldCan she be
