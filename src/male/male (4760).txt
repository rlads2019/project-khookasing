Baby is mellowSoft as the skyBells they won't bellowDon't ask me whyFast as the sunriseCold as her dark eyesApril will never be the sameThe sun it ain't shiningClosing my eyesDays are spent piningDon't ask me whyCan't let this heart die From saying one goodbyeApril will never be the sameWait until the moring comes throughFast becoming dawnSee a reflection only of youIt's dawn but she's goneCause baby was mellowSoft as the skyBells they won't bellowI'll tell you whyGone is the sunriseGone are her dark eyesBut april will always come again
