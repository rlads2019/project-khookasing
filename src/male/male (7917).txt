大地恢復安靜月亮已蘇醒我心裡有一點小聲音等她的回應如漫遊在夢境微風很動聽比不上我看著她雙眼最美的風景Can you feel the love tonightThe peace the evening bringsThe world for once in perfect harmonyWith all it's living things想跟她傾訴心情如何讓她感應 關於我的過去太難為情她會離我而去He's holding back he's hidingBut what I can't decideWhy won't he be the king I know he isThe king I see insideCan you feel the love tonightThe peace the evening bringsThe world for once in perfect harmonyWith all it's living thingsCan you feel the love tonightYou needn't look too farStealing through the nights uncertaintiesLove is where they areCan you feel the love tonight
