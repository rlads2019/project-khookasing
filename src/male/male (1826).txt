And the second timeIs always harder that the firstForgetting lines that I'd rehearsedI fear the best, I fear the worstLove is brave, it has ambition Unafraid makes no conditionWhen I say how much I love youYou feel I know you a thousand yearsFor the second timeI feel I'm starting something newPlease understand the things I doI'm unpredictable with you
