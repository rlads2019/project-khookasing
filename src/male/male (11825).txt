Take a bow, the night is overThis masquerade is getting olderLight are low, the curtains downThere's no one hereSay your lines but do you feel themDo you mean what you say when there's no one aroundWatching you, watching me, one lonely starI've always been in love with youI guess you've always known it's trueYou took my love for granted, why oh whyThe show is over, say good-byeSay good-bye, say good-byeMake them laugh, it comes so easyWhen you get to the partWhere you're breaking my heartHide behind your smile, all the world loves a clownWish you well, I cannot stayYou deserve an award for the role that you played No more masquerade, you're one lonely starI've always been in love with youI guess you've always known it's trueYou took my love for granted, why oh whyThe show is over, say good-byeSay good-bye, say good-byeAll the world is a stageAnd everyone has their partBut how was I to know which way the story'd goHow was I to know you'd breakYou'd break my heartI've always been in love with youGuess you've always knownYou took my love for granted, why oh whyThe show is over, say good-byeSay good-bye, say good-byeSay good-bye
