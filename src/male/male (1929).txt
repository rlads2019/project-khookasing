Is this a lasting treasureOr just a moment's pleasureCan I believe the magic of your sighsWill you still love me tomorrowTonight with words unspoken You say that I'm the only oneBut will my heart be brokenWhen the night meets the morning sunI'd like to know that your loveIs love I can be sure ofSo tell me now, and I won't ask againWill you still love me tomorrow
