I remember April when the sun was in th skyAnd love was burning in your eyesNothing in the world could bother meCause I was living in the world of made believe*I'm just a daydreamerwalking in the rain Chasing after rainbowsI'm in never fine againLife is much too beatifulTo live it all I knowOh How much I need someone to go my very ownI'm just a daydreamer Oh Oh......Ah Ah......
