*when you come to me on a summer breezeKeep me warm in your love then you softly leaveAnd it's me you need to showHow deep is your love ( x 3)I really need to learnCause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and me*I believe in youYou know the door to my barest soulYou're the light in my deepest darkest hour You're my saviour when I fallAnd you may not think that I care for youWhen you know down inside that I really doAnd it's me you need to showHow deep is your love (x 3)I really need to learnCause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us down when they all should let us beWe belong to you and merepeat *How deep is your love how deep is your loveI really need to learnCause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us down when they all should let us beWe belong to you and me
