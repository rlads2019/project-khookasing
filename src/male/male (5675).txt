Why does the sun go on shining?Why does the sea rush to shore?Don't they know it's the end of the world'Cause you don't love me anymore?Why do the birds go on singing?Why do the stars glow above?Don't they know it's the end of the worldIt ended when I lost your love I wake up in the morning and I wonderWhy everything is the same as it wasI can't understand, no, I can't understandHow life goes on the way it does!Why does my heart go on beating?Why do these eyes of mine crying?Don't they know it's the end of the world?It ended when you said goodbyeDon't they know it's the end of the world?
