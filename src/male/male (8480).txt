I step off the trainI'm walking down your street againAnd past your doorBut you don't live there anymoreIt's years since you've been there(And) Now you're disappeared somewhere like outer spaceYou've found some better placeAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rainCould you be dead?You always were two steps ahead of everyoneWe'd walk behind while you would run I look up at your houseAnd I can almost hear you shout down to meWhere I always used to beAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rainBack on the trainI ask did I come again?Can I confess I've been hanging round your old dress?And the years have proved to offer nothing since you movedYou've long gone but I can't move onAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rainAnd I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
