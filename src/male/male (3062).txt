 Love in the shadows where the crowd never goesDeep in the shadows where flowers won't growMe and my baby know love in the shadowsIn the shadowsYou got to work at love to get it to shineYou can't believe in everything that you seeNot this time around'Cause the shadowsCan play a half a million tricks on your mindYou try your best but you can never break freeIt just kind of drags you downLove in the shadows Love in the shadowsLove in the shadows
