You're just too good to be trueCan't take my eyes off youYou feel like heaven to touchI wanna hold you so muchAt long last love has arrivedAnd I thank God I'm aliveYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my eyes off youPardon the way that I stareThere's nothing else to compareThe sight of you leaves me weakThere are no words left to speak But if you feel like I feelPlease let me know that it's realYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my eyes off youI love you babyAnd if it's quite all rightI need you baby to warm the lonely nightI love you babyTrust in me when I sayOh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I prayOh pretty baby, now that I found you StaySo let me love you, babyLet me love you(*)
