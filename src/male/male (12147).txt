I can feel the night upon my skin and I can't sleepYou know I want you, you know I want youI can feel the fire, my desire burns so deepI need to love you,to feel you want me tooAnd I never knew I could love you this wayAnd I want you more than I ever could sayDon't make me wait, baby do it againOver and over again(Chorus)Your lips, speak without, speak without wordsI can feel you deep inside of meFeel my body sweetly lose controlSpeak without, speak without wordsWhen we kiss I feel the mysteryTouch my body and my soulIn the velvet silence I reach out to touch your skinAnd there is magic, in every part of me When I hear your voice inside my head and I beginTo understand your secret poetryAnd I never knew I could love you this wayAnd I want you more than I ever could sayPlease baby, please baby, do it againOver and over again(Chorus)Your lips, speak without, speak without words etc.And I nevr knew that your love was so strongAnd I never knew it could last so longI'm gonna do everything that you wantTonight, oh baby,just reach out(Spanish chorus)ã€€Tus Labios, habian En to poder mientrego a la passionHaslan sin,Hablan sin decir Tu me resas y te biento aquiEn fundo do mi corazon
