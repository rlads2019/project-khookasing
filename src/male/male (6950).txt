Dreams they're for those who sleep,Life is for us to keep,And if you're wond'ringWhat this song is leading toI want to make it with youI really think that we can make it girl.No, you don't know me well,In ev'ry little thing only time will tell,If you believe the things that I do.And we'll see it through. Life can be short or long,Love can be right or wrong,And if I choose the oneI'd like to help me through,I'd like to make it with youI really think that we can make it girl.Baby you know thatDreams they're for those who sleep,Life is for us to keepAnd if I choose the oneI'd like to help me through,I'd like to make it with youI really think that we can make it girl
