Aah...I know your eyes in the morning sunI feel you touch me in the pouring rainAnd the moment that you wander far from meI wanna feel you in my arms againAnd you come to me on a summer breezeKeep me warm in your love, then you softly leaveAnd it's me you need to showHow deep is your loveDeep is your loveHow deep is your loveI really need to learn'cause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meI believe in youYou know the door to my very soulYou're the light in my deepest darkest hourYou're my saviour when I fallAnd you may not thinkI care for youWhen you know down inside that I really doAnd it's me you need to showHow deep is your love Deep is your loveHow deep is your loveI really need to learn'cause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meAnd you come to me on a summer breezeKeep me warm in your love, then you softly leaveAnd it's me you need to showHow deep is your loveDeep is your lovehow deep is your loveI really need to learn'cause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meAh.Deep is your loveHow deep is your loveI really need to learn'cause we're living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and me
