(Reba)There were no angry words at allAs we carried boxes down the hallOne by one put them in your car(Jacky)Nothing much for us to sayOne last goodbye and you drove awayI watched your tail-lights　As they faded in the dark(Reba)I couldn't face the night in that lonely bedSo I laid down on the couch instead(Chorus) (duet)　Last night I prayed the lord my soul to keepThen I cried myself to sleep　So sure life wouldn't go on without you But oh this sun is blinding me　As it wakes me from the darkI guess the world didn't stop　For my broken heart(Jacky)Clock stiil tickin', life goes onRadio still plays a song　As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place(Reba)And it takes all the strength I've gotTo stumble to the coffee potThe first many lonely mornings I've got to face(Jacky)You call to see if I'm okLook out the window and I just say　Repeat chorus(Reba)For my broken heart(Jacky)I guess the world ain't gonna stop　For my broken heart
