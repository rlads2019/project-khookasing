Dream that I never hadSince the pedals dieIt was all just like a simple matterNow that we stand apartTimes the only hope I seeNothing left surely nothing to regainLonging for the days with you I won't forgetLooking at the flower leavesI won't regret to the endEveryday my thoughts wanna to your caressBut the only warmth I get is shattered vaseI believe the flower bloom againIt won't take too longMy dream will never be gone
