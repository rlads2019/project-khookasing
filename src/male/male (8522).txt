She's faced the hardest times you could imageAnd many times her eyes fought back me tearsAnd when her youthful world was about to fall inEach time her slender shoulderBore the weight of all her tearsAnd a sorrow no one hearsStill rings in midnight silence in her earsLet her cry for she's a ladyLet her dream for she's a childLet the rain fall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild And if by chance I should hold herLet me hold her for a timeAnd if allowed but one possessionI would pick her from the garden to be mineBe careful how you touch she'll awakenAnd sleep the only freedom that she knowsAnd when you walk into her eyes you won't believeThe way she's always paying for a debt she never owesAnd a silent wind still blows that only she can hearAnd so she goes
