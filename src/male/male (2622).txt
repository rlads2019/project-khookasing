Ma, take the badge off of meI can't use it any moreIt's getting dark, too, dark to seeFeel like I'm knockin' on heaven's doorKnock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doorKnock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doorKnock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doorKnock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doorMa, take these guns away from meI can't shoot them any moreThere's a long black cloud following meFeel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
