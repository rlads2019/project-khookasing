When men grow oldDo they lose sensitivityWhen men grow oldThey forget how to loveWhen men grow oldThey have no sense of loyaltyWell if that's how it isI don't wanna grow anymoreSo many nights when you sat aloneHe's out with his friends like he's got no homeBut you understood that he needed his spaceBut now it seems like that he's always gone And he won't admit thatthere's something wrongHe finds a young girl who will take your placeThe first thing you do,you go get your hair doneBut he doesn't notice a thingIt's not s'posed to be that way(Hook)Time after timeYear after yearSo many women are drowning in tearsWaiting and hoping and praying for loveSomething that most men don'tknow the true meaning ofWhy can't they just open their hearts,don't they fall in love(Hook)
