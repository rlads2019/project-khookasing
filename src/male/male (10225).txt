Rain began to fall softlyAs she gazzed around the roomEven now she wondered what went wrongA letter in her hand trembledAs she placed it by the phoneAll at once there were footsteps by the doorShe didn't want a confrontationTo tear them apartShe wasn't sure of the feelingsRacing through her heartI looked into her eyesKnowing something wasn't rightAnd suddenly the tears began to showHow I wish I could tell you that I amBut before I even read this letterI want you to stayBut if I see your mind's made upThere's one thing I've got to say You can call meBaby if you ever change your mindBelieve me when I say to youAnytime will be alrightYou can call meOnly seven numbers on the phoneMaybe we can talk things overYou're never that far from homeOh,no no baby you're not aloneAnother seasonAnother changeTwo hearts are breakingWith no one to blameI know the reasonsYou want to goBut if you find that you still want meThere's one thing that you know
