Anyone who ever held youWould tell you the way I'm feelingAnyone who ever wanted youWould try to tell you what I feel insideThe only thing I ever wantedWas the feeling that you ain't fakingThe only one you ever thought aboutWait a minute can't you see that II wanna fall from the starsStraight into you armsI, I feel youI hope you comprehend For the man who tried to hurt youHe's explaining the way I'm feelingFor all the jealousy I caused youStates the reason why I'm trying to hideAs for all the things you taught meIt sends my future into clearer dimensionsYou'll never know how much you hurt meStay a minute can't you see that IToo many hearts are brokenA lover's promise never came with a maybeSo many words are left unsplkenThe silent voices are driving me crazyAs for all the pain you caused me
