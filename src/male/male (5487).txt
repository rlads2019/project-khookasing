Girl you are my songYou are the melodyAnd you're the harmonyGirl you 're in my mindSpinning around my brainAnd I go insaneYou light up my lifeYou make the sunshineAnd you keep away the rainSweet is your emotionGirl you are my songYou are the melodyAnd harmonyBabe you're the only Music of my lifeIf it never ends I'll never tiredWhen you're happyMakes me feel so goodWhen you're sad IFeel the same way tooYou are my songFly listening to youMakes me feel so lightYou're the oneWho sets me in the skyYou control the rhythm of my heartAnd I hope that it will never stopYou are my girl
