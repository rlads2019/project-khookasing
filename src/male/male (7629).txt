This love has taken it's toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeAnd her heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymoreI tried my best to feed her appetiteKeep her coming every nightSo hard to keep her satisfiedKept playing love like it was just a gamePretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave againThis love has taken it's toll on meShe said goodbye too many times beforeAnd her heart is breaking in front of meI have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymoreI'll fix these broken thingsRepair your broken wingsAnd make sure everything's alrightMy pressure on her hipsSinking my fingertipsInto every inch of youCause I know that's what you want me to do
