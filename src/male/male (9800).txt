Oceans apart day after dayAnd I slowly go insaneI hear your voice on the lineBut it doesn't stop the painIf I see you next to neverHow can we say foreverWherever you go, whatever you doI will be right here waiting for youWhatever it takes or how my heart breaksI will be right here waiting for youI took for granted all the timesThat I thought would last somehowI hear the laughter, I taste the tearsBut I can't get near you nowOh can't you see it baby You've got me goin crazyWherever you go, whatever you doI will be right here waiting for youWhatever it takes or how my heart breaksI will be right here waiting for youI wonder how we can survive this romanceBut in the end if I'm with you I'll take the chanceOh can't you see it babyYou've got me goin crazyWherever you go, whatever you doI will be right here waiting for youWhatever it takes or how my heart breaksI will be right here waiting for you
