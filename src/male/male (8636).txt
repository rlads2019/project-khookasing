Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little placeAnd have a drink or twoAnd then I go and spoil it allBy saying something stupidLike I love youI can see it in your eyesYou still despise the same old linesYou heard the night beforeAnd though it's just a line to youFor me it's trueAnd never seemed so right beforeI practice every day to find some cleverlines to sayTo make the meaning come true But then I think I'll wait until the eveninggets lateAnd I'm alone with youThe time is rightYour perfume fills my headThe stars get redAnd oh the night's so blueAnd then I go and spoil it allBy saying something stupidLike I love youThe time is rightYour perfume fills my headThe stars get redAnd oh the night's so blueAnd then I go and spoil it allBy saying something stupidLike I love youI love you...
