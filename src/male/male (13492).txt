There's so much lifeI've left to liveAnd this fire's burning stillWhen I watch you look at meI think I could find a wayTo stand for every dreamAnd forsake this solid groundAnd give up this fear withinOf what would happen if they ever knewI'm in love with you'Cause I'd surrender everythingTo feel the chance, to live againI reach to youI know you can feel it tooWe'd make it throughA thousand dreams I still believeI'd make you give them all to meI'd hold you in my arms and never let goI surrenderI knowI can't survive another night away from youYou're the reason I go onAnd now I need to live the truthRight now, there's no better timeFrom this fear, I will break freeAnd I'll live again with loveAnd know they can't take that away from meAnd they will see'Cause I'd surrender everythingTo feel the chance, to live againI reach to you I know you can feel it tooWe'd make it throughA thousand dreams I still believeI'll make you give them all to meI'll hold you in my arms and never let goI surrenderEvery night gets longerAnd this voice's getting stronger babyI'll swallow my prideAnd I'll be aliveCan't you hear my call?I surrender all(I'll surrender everything)(To feel the chance, to live again)I reach to youI know you can feel it tooWe'll make it throughA thousand dreams I still believeI'll make you give them all to meI'll hold you in my arms and never let goI surrenderRight here, right nowI'd give my life to live againI'll break freeTake me, my everythingI surrender all to youRight nowI'd give my life to live againI'll break free, Take meMy everythingI surrender
