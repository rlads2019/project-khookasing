We lived in the country when I was a childYou lived down the highway about half a mileWe laughed away the hours, running to and froTell me baby,where did the good times goI can still remember, summers in the shadeWinters by the fire place, the promises we madeYou said you'd always love me,What happened I don't knowBaby baby,where did the good times goWhere did all the good times goWhere did they goTell me woman if you knowWhere did the good times go
