Baby, do you understand me nowSometimes I feel a little madBut don't you knowthat no one alive can call me an angelWhen things go wrong I feel real badI'm just a soul whose intentions are goodOh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodBaby, sometimes I'm so carefreeWith a joy that's hard to hideAnd sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worryAnd then you're bound to see my other side I'm just a soul whose intentions are goodOh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodIf I seem edgyI want you to knowThat I never meant to take it out on youLife has its problems and I get my shareAnd that's one thing I never meant to doOh, oh, oh, baby - don't you know I'm humanI have thoughts like any other oneSometimes I find myself, Lord, regrettingSome foolish thing - some little simple thing I've done
