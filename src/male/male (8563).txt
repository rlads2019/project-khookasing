There's a peaceful easy feelingBlowing softly thru the treesWhich welcomes in the morning lightThat shines for me to seeAnd it takes me past my sorrowAnd keeps me from the rainFor all these things I'd like toThank you once againThere's a stairway in the mountainsAnd it leads up to the starsAnd stars canã€€move the clouds awayAnd keep me from the darkAnd when I feel alone and lostThey'll show me the wayFor all these things I'd like to thank you once again Chorus:Thank you for the loveThat's right here in this songThank you for my dreamsFor everythingLife has given meWe seldom stop to think thatWe have travelled very farSeen and heard a million thingsEven wished upon a starCared for all the close friendsWho have passed along the wayFor all these things and moreThank you once again
