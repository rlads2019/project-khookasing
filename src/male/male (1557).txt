So the stars still gleam in the skyAnd the moon rises up in the nightDeep from withincomes the light of hopeCompassion and love unfoldAs their hearts go out full of mercy to the worldOnly bleed to see the earth in despairWith grace they would lift all the suffering and painThey'll be there till the end of the time
