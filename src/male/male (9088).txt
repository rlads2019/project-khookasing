I was standing All alone against the world outside.You were search for a place to hideLost and lonely Now you've given me the will to survive.When we're hungry .....love will keep us aliveDon't you worry Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride.The world is changing Right before your eyesNow I've found you There's no more emptiness inside .When we're hungry...love will keep us aliveI would die for you Climb the highest mountain Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't doNow I've found you There's no more emptiness inside .When we're hungry...love will keep us aliveI would die for you Climb the highest mountain Baby,there's nothing I wouldn't doI was standing All alone against the world outside.You were searching for a place to hideLost and lonely Now you've given me the will to survive.When we're hungry .....love will keep us alive
