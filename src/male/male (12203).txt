What kind of manWould leave a woman standing in the coldMust've been a silly oneTo sacrifice a pot of goldYou're the kind of womanThat needs a man that's always thereIt's not that you require a lotJust ned some tender love and careI give good loveI'll buy your clothesSoon as I get home from workI'll pay your rentYour faithful loverSoon as I get home from worksoon as I get home from workGirl, I'll treat you rightAnd I'll never lieFor all it's worthI give good love (good love,good love, good love, good love)It doesn't make senseThat you should have a broken heart If I were the only oneI'd never let you fall apartYou're the kind of womanThat needs a man with lots of cashWith a stack of major credit cardsAnd with me you don't have to askI give good loveI'll buy your clothesI'll cook your dinner tooSoon as I get home from workI'll pay your rentYour faithful loverSoon as I get home from work,soon as I get home from workGirl, I'll treat you rightAnd I'll never lie or flirtSoon as I get home, soon as I get homeGirl I'll be around, never let you downFor all it's worthI give good love (good love,good love, good love, good love)I give good love (good love,good love, good love, good love)(Hook)
