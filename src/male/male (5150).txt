Now I 'm...I'm standing above you trying so hard notTo tell you I lobe youAnd all that I want in this world is youIf you'd only wake upYou'd know it was true Oh baby I love you can be so hard to sayEspecially when it's meant in this strong a wayBut at this moment while you lie asleepI am suddenly freeAnd my trembling arms reach out for youAs if you could see,Now I'm...I'm standing above you trying so hard notTo tell you I love you,And all that I want in this world is youIf you'd only wake up you'd know it was trueIf you'd only wake up you'd know it was true
