How can I just let you walk awayJust let you leave without a traceWhen I stand here taking every breath with youYou're the only one who really knew me at allHow can you just walk away from meWhen all I can do is watch you leave'Cause we shared the laughter and the painAnd even shared the tearsYou're the only one who really knew me at allSo take a look at me nowWho has just an empty spaceAnd there's nothing left here to remind meJust a memory of your faceWell take a look at me nowThere's just an empty spaceAnd you comin' back to me is against the oddsAnd that's what I've got to face I wish I could just make you turn aroundTurn around and see me cryThere's so much I need to say to youSo many reasons whyYou're the only one who really knew me at allSo take a look at me nowWho has just an empty spaceAnd there's nothing left here to remind meJust a memory of your faceNow take a look at me now'Cause there's just an empty spaceAnd that's what I've got to faceTake a good look at me nowTake a good look at me nowAnd you comin' back to me is against the oddsIs the chance I've gotta takeTake a look at me now
