I hardly know what to sayBut maybe it's better that wayIf poppa were here I'm sure he'd tell herShannon is gone I heardShe's drifting out to seaShe always loved to swim awayAh....Maybe she'll find an island With a shaded treeJust like the one in our backyardAh...Mama tries hard to pretendThat things will get better againSomehow she's keepin' it all inside herBut finally the tears fill our eyesAnd I know that somewhere tonightShe knows how much we really miss her
