Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlingDo you feel my heart beatingDo you feel the sameAm I only dreamingIs this buring an eternal flameI believe it's meant to be, daringI watch you when you are sleepingYou belong with meDo you feel the sameAm I only dreamingOr is this buring an eternal flameSay my name sun shines through the rainA whole life so lonelyAnd then you come and ease the painI don't want to lose this feeling
