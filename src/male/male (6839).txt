Run to me, when ever you're lonely.Run to me, if you need a shoulder.Now and then you'll need someone older.So darling, you run to me.So darling, you run to me.And when you're out in the cold.No one beside you and no one to hold. Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me.And when you've got nothing to lose.Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose.Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me.Run to me, when ever you're lonely.Run to me, if you need a shoulder.Now and then you'll need someone older.So darling, you run to me.Run to me, when ever you're lonely.Run to me, if you need a shoulder.Now and then you'll need someone older.So darling, you run to me.
