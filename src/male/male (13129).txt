In the middle of the nightWhen our hopes and fears collideIn the midst of all goodbyesWhere all human beings lie, against another lieWhisper broken promises, there we hideTry to make it seem alrightWhat goes around againWe'd be running from the painFinding shelter in the rainLovers straying, seasons changing, strangers to loversWhat comes around againYou'd fall asleep in my embraceSteal a kiss on your little faceWould have always been in that wayBut heyYou're never coming back, never coming backI'll be waiting anyway, I'll be waiting anywayUntil the dayIn the middle of the nightLonely souls travel in timeFamiliar hearts start to entwineWe imagine what we'll find in another lifeWhisper broken promises, there we hideTry to make it seem alright What goes around againWe'd be running from the painFinding shelter in the rainLover straying, seasons changing strangers to loversWhat comes around againYou'd fall asleep in my embraceSteal a kiss in your little faceWould have always been in that wayBut heyYou're never coming back, never coming backI'll be waiting anyway, I'll be waiting anywayTill it comes around againWe'd be playing in the sandHolding hands, just one last chanceNo more hurts, no more goodbyesWe'd danceWe're never going backNever turning backWon't you wait with me anyway, won't you wait with me anywayUntil the dayWhat comes around goes aroundWhat goes around comes aroundUntil the day
