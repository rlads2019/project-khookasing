Well it's one for the money　Two for the showThree get ready now go cat goBut don't you step on my blue suede shoes(Well) You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoesYou can knock me down　Step on my faceSlander my name all over the placeDo anything that you wanna doBut ah ah honey lay off my shoesDon't you step on blue suede shoes (Well) You can burn my house　Steal my carDrink my liques from the old fruit jarDo anything that you want to doBut ah ah honey lay off of my shoesBut don't you step on my blue suede shoesWell you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoesBlue blue blue suede shoes　Blue blue blue suede shoesBlue blue blue suede shoes　Blue blue blue suede shoesYou can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
