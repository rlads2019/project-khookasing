CHORUSHonesty is such a lonely wordEveryone is so untrueHonesty is hardly ever heardAnd mostly what I need from youI can always find someoneTo say they sympathizeIf I wear my heart out on my sleeveBut I don't want some pretty faceTo tell me pretty liesAll I want is someone to believe CHORUSI can find a loverI can find a friendI can have securityUntil the bitter endAnyone can comfort meWith promises againI know, I knowWhen I'm deep inside of meDon't be too concernedI won't ask for nothin' while I'm goneBut when I want sincerityTell me where else can I turnBecause you're the one that I depend uponCHORUS
