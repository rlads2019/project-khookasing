Last night　I saw your picture on the wallThe one we took beforeThen I　I tried to reach you on the phoneI'm feeling down　Feeling down　Down .............Feeling down　Feeling lonely　No one wanna talk to meThough I know　You're seeing someoneBut I thought　It can't be so bad I know　I know　One day you gonna come back homeNever ever let　Let me down　Let me down don't let me downNever ever let　Let me down woo　Can we be friends forever?Never ever let　Let me down　Let me down don't let me downI'm feeling so bad　Have you ever feltSo bad　I don't want you to be sad!
