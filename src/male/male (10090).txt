I can tell by your eyesThat you probably been crying foreverAnd the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to youThey're a mirrorI don't wanna talk about itHow you broke my heartIf I stay here just a little bit longerIf I stay here won't you listenTo my heart,oh,oh,my heartIf I stand all aloneWill the shadow hide the color of my heartBlue for the tearsBlack for the night's fearsThe stars in the sky don't mean nothing to youThey're a mirror I don't want to talk about itHow you broke this old heartIf I stay here just a little bit longerIf I stay here won't you listenTo my heart,oh,oh,my heartIf I stand all aloneWill the shadow hide the color of my heartBlue for the tearsBlack for the night's fearsThe stars in the sky don't mean nothing to youThey're a mirrorI don't want to talk about itHow you broke this old heartIf I stay here just a little bit longerIf I stay here won't you listenTo my heart,oh my heartMy heart,oh my heart
