Paging all my people who are hurtIn the desert of their liesWe won't take this from them anymoreWe're not astrayWe're not ashamedCome on down my friend from hereThere's a chance, I know, of rainWash those tears you have insideIt's a fear, it will subsideYou should try, you should tryChange it any way you canRhyme it like the Muffin ManYou should try, you should try#You don't need to hide it anymoreIt's OK, you can feelI don't have to tell you who you are You're a star, you're a starCome on down my friend, I knowThis is life, and we've got to go#*Wash those tears you have insideIt's a fear, it will subsideYou should try, you should tryChange it any way you canRhyme it like the Muffin ManYou should try, you should try*Repeat #**Every time I see your faceYou look at me with foolish eyesEverybody hold your horsesDon't believe in what they sayEveryone is here tonightSo you should try 感謝 E  提供歌詞
