作詞：鄭慧文Andrea Apuy作曲：黃偉恆Alexander Wong編曲：黃偉恆Alexander WongSo now we are here,So now it is clear your choice is made.I warn you not to stay,I may hurt and leave you here betrayed.The spirits play,Tricks on my mind,Will you be strong enough to face my darkness inside?Do you hear my cries for you?Will you help me fight on through?Or are you haunting me?And do you see me as I am? Or will you save me from the damned?Are you, just here and haunting me?The spirits say,My end is nigh,Will you be swift enough to slay my demons inside?Do you hear my cries to you?Will you help me fight on through?Or are you haunting me?And do you see me as I am?Or will you save me from the damned?Are you, just here and haunting me?Just here and haunting me?
