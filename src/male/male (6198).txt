It took a while to happen　But I woke up to youThe promises you made of love　You never saw them throughSo darlin don't you cryTonight there's gonna be no lullabies for you and me...Can't you seeHey little girl　I'll make you understandI can never feel never feel that way again And now you believeHey little girl　I'll make you understandI can never feel that way againAnd now you believe...　Can't feel that way againNo more magic in our love affair　The dreams we had for twoOne tragic night, it's finally overBelieve in bad love you're through　So darlin don't you cryTonight there's gonna be no lullabies for you
