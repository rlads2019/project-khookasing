Couple of times turned to every night there was only usTill you shot me down, when I wasn't around you were messing upYou tryAnd say you're coming byI'm breaking insideBut I got no room for youCuz I leveledI pulled myself togetherI'm doing so much betterNow I got no room for you, for youWhen you pull me close ILose myself in your eyesYou take hold of my mindTrying to get throughNow you're coming back hereKnocking on my heart sphereI won't let you past, there'sNo room for you You're so persuasive, I feel myself changing with every touchYou're so amazing, you'll save me before you run out of loveYou tryAnd say you're coming byI'm breaking insideBut I got no room for youCuz I leveledI pulled myself togetherI'm doing so much betterNow I got no room for you, for youWhen you pull me close ILose myself in your eyesYou take hold of my mindTrying to get throughNow you're coming back hereKnocking on my heart sphereBut I won't let you past, there'sNo room for you
