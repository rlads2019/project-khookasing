The thousand dreams I dreamed the splendid things I plannedI always built alas on weak and shifting sandI lived by night and shunned the naked light of dayAnd only now I see how the years ran awayYesterday when I was youngSo many happy songs were waiting to be sungSo many wild pleasures lay in store for meAnd so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to seeI ran so fast that time and youth at last ran outI never stopped to think what life was all aboutAnd every conversation I can now recall Concerned itself with me and nothing else at allThe game of love I played with arrogance and prideAnd every flame I lit too quickly quickly diedThe friends I made all seemed somehow to drift awayAnd only now I am left alone to end the playYesterday when I was youngSo many lovely songs are waiting to be sungSo many wild pleasure lay in store for meAnd so much pain my eyes refused to seeThere are so many songs in me that won't be sungI feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongueThe time has come for me to payFor yesterday when I was young
