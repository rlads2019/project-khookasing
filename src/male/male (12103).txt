Karen she's a silver sunYou best walk her way and watch it shiningWatch her watch the morning comeA silver tear appearing now I'm cryingAingt I going to Carolina in my mindThere aingt no doubt in no one's mindThat loves the finest thing aroundWhisper something soft and kindAnd hey babe the sky's on fire, I'm dyingAingt I going to Carolina in my mindIn my mind I'm going to CarolinaCangt you see the sunshineCangt you just feel the moonshineAingt it just like a friend of mineTo hit me from behindYes I'm going to Carolina in my mind Dark and silent late last nightI think I might have heard the highway callingGeese in flight and dogs that biteSigns that might be omens say I going, goingI'm going to Carolina in my mindWith a holy host of others standing 'round meStill I'm on the dark side of the moonAnd it seems like it goes on like this foreverYou must forgive meIf I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mindIn my mind I'm going to CarolinaCangt you see the sunshineCangt you just feel the moonshineAingt it just like a friend of mineTo hit me from behindYes I'm going to Carolina in my mindGoing to Carolina in my mindAnd I'm going to Carolina in my mindGoing to Carolina in my mind
