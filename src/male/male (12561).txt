執起筆想寫再見　算算有那個想見至發覺世上還有太多可戀這首歌應該抱怨　卻教我從頭充了電假使我要更愛目前　天天當做最终那天天天講聽朝會變　而明晨何其遙遠何況當　無明天I wanna change, why not? I need a break, why not?I want to feel loveI wanna dance, why not? I wanna sing, why not?I want to be lovedI wanna fly, why not ? I wanna dive, why not?I want to feel lifeI wanna smile, why not? I wanna cry, why not?I'm singing alive即使間悲觀似我　世界有我也不錯有了這覺悟還有那些不可想不通怎麼約過　最諷刺憑遺囑協助 花凋鏡破　寄語若何光陰有盡　愛惜更多一朝將生死看破　原來能從頭來過仍然有　何其多I wanna change, why not? I need a break, why not?I want to feel loveI wanna dance, why not? I wanna sing, why not?I want to be lovedI wanna fly, why not ? I wanna dive, why not?I want to feel lifeI wanna smile, why not? I wanna cry, why not?I'm singing aliveI wanna change, why not? I need a break, why not?I want to feel loveI wanna dance, why not? I wanna sing, why not?I want to be lovedI wanna fly, why not ? I wanna dive, why not?I want to feel lifeI wanna smile, why not? I wanna cry, why not?I'll beat the deadline
