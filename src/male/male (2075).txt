When I fall in loveIt will be foreverFor I'll never fall in loveIn a restless world like this isLove is ended before it's begunAnd too many moonlight kissesSeem to cool in the warmth of the sun When I give my heartIt will be completelyFor I'll never give my heartAnd the moment I can fell thatYou fell that way tooThat is, when I fall in love with youWhen I fall in love with you
