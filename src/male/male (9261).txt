All your life you've waited for love to come and stayAnd now that I have found youyou must not slip awayI know it's hard believin' the words you've heard beforebut darlin' you must trust them just once more'Cause m' baby goodbye doesn't mean foreverlet me tell you goodbye doesn't mean We'll never be together againIf you wake up and I'm not thereI won't be long away'cause the things you do my goodbye girl will bring me back to you I know you've been taken afraid to hurt againYou fight the love you feel for me instead of givin' inBut i can wait foreverwhile helpin' you to see that I was meant for you and you for meSo remember goodbye doesn't mean foreverLet me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together againThough we may be so far apart you still would have my heartSo forget your past my goodbye girl'cause now you're home at last
