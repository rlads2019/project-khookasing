It ain't right with love to share When you find she doesn't care for youIt ain't wise to need someoneAs much as I depended on youIt's a heartache, nothing but a heartacheHits you when it's too lateHits you when you're downIt's a fool's game, nothing but a fool's gameStanding in the cold rainFeeling like a clown, it's a heartache
