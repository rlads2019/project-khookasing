Both afraid to say we're being too far awayFrom being close together from the startWe tried to talk it overBut the words got in the way We're lost insideThis lonely game we playThroughts of leaving disappearEvery time I see your eyesAnd no matter how hard I tryTo understand the reasonThat we carry on this wayAnd we're lost in this masquerade
