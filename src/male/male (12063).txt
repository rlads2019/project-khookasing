An angel's smile is what you sellYou promise me heaven, then put me through hellChains of love got a hold on meWhen passion's a prison, you can't break freeOh, you're a loaded gun, yeahOh, there's nowhere to runNo one can save meThe damage is doneShot through the heartAnd you're to blameYou give love a bad nameI play my part and you play your gameYou give love a bad nameAnd you give love a bad nameYou paint your smile on your lipsBlood red nails on your fingertipsA school boy's dream, you act so shyYour very first kiss was your first kiss goodbyeOh, you're a loaded gunOh, there's nowhere to runNo one can save meThe damage is doneShot through the heartAnd you're to blame You give love a bad nameI play my part and you play your gameYou give love a bad nameYou give loveOh, shot through the heartAnd you're to blameYou give love a bad nameI play my part and you play your gameYou give love a bad nameShot through the heartAnd you're to blameYou give love a bad nameI play my part and you play your gameYou give love a bad nameYou give loveYou give love a bad nameYou give loveYou give love a bad nameYou give loveYou give love a bad nameYou give loveYou give love a bad name
