Catch my breathe, close my eyes, don't believe a word.Things she's said overheard, something's wrong inside.It's when you admit it, oh- then you know you've read it, oh-I've been in love before.　I've been in love before.The hardest part is when you are in it.I've been in love before.　I've been in love before.Just one touch, just one look, a dangerous noise.One small breathe can make me feel like running away.You can't say you've read it, no, until you've reach the limit.I've been in love before. I've been in love before.The hardest part is when you are in it.I've been in love before.　I've been in love before.I've been in love before.The hardest part is when you are in it.I've been in love before.
