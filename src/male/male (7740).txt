You're my ladyCome let me hold youYou are the starI wish on every eveningYou're my ladyYou are my world tonightMy world tonight my ladyAbout as often as I grieveI think of you and I am strongerWith faith to try againOr question why againTo feel you close to feel so much And if I face on endless sleepYou're all the thingsI choose to dream ofTo make the night worthWhile I'll think about your smileAnd of the daysWhen I could touch youAnd early angel of the nightsAnd you spend the nights with meIn your arms my heart is hopeIt's like heaven just to me with youMy lady come let me hold youYou are the starI wish on every eveningYou're my ladyYou are my world tonightMy world tonightI breathe for you my ladyYou are my lady
