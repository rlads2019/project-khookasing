You hear me so clearlyAnd see how I tryYou feel me so heal meAnd tear me apartAnd I won't tell a soulI won't tell at allAnd do they have to knowAbout my good night girlCut up in your wishin' wellYour hopes and sadnessTake your love in promisesYou make them last, you make them last You keep me so near youAnd see me so farAnd hold me and send meAnd deep in your heartAnd I won't tell a soulI won't tell at allAnd I won't let them knowAbout my good night girlDoesn't matter how sad I made youDoesn't matter how hard I tryJust remember the same old reasonin your eyessaid you want me
