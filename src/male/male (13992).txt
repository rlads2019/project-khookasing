I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away我壓抑了所有的希望所有的夢Just in case I ever need them again someday或許有一天我會再找回渴望I've been setting aside time我仍保留著一些些時間To clear a little space in the corners of my mind在心靈深處　挪出了一點點空間All I wanna do is find a way back into love我好想再回到愛I can't make it through without a way back into love我怎能不再回到愛Oh oh ohI've been watching but the stars refuse to shine我仰望　但星光無言I've been searching but I just don't see the signs我追尋　但天地無情I know that it's out there但我知道就在某個遠方There's got to be something for my soul somewhere那裡一定有我靈魂的歸屬I've been looking for someone to shed some light我仍渴求能給我曙光的那個人Not somebody just to get me throught the night而不只是陪我虛渡長夜的那個誰 I could use some direction一個指引我何去何從的人And I'm open to your suggestions一個讓我敞開了心房的人All I wanna do is find a way back into love我好想再回到愛I can't make it through without a way back into love我怎能不再回到愛And if I open my heart again如果我重新打開心房I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end我想陪我到最後的一定非你莫屬There are moments when I don't know if it's real有時候我覺得一切如夢似幻Or if anybody feels the way I feel不確定是否有人也與我心心相印I need inspiration我需要的是一點心有靈犀Not just another negotiation我不要再一次彼此妥協All I wanna do is find a way back into love我好想再回到愛I can't make it 'ture' without a way back into love我怎能不再回到愛And if I open my heart to you如果我再對你敞開心房I'm hoping you'll show me what to do我要你告訴我什麼是愛And if you help me to start again如果讓我重新再來的　非你莫屬You know that I'll be there for you in the end請相信　陪你到最後的一定非我莫屬
