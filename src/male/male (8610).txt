Nature is foreverThe home for all mankindAnd nature is emotionThat makes you feel aliveAnd time will passAnd you at lastWill live life all too fastSo slow the paceAnd lift your faceAnd heaven will remind youThat nature is the reasonThat everything is fineBut nature needs attentionWe're running out of timeAnd soon you'll learnThat it's your turnTo take her back to youThe change must come one by oneIt has to start with you And time will passAnd you at lastWill live life all too fastSo slow the paceAnd lift your faceAnd heaven will remind you(choir) Nature is foreverThe home for all mankindNature is believingOur dreams will never dieWe laugh and cryWe live our livesAnd never realizeWe think we knowBut even soLife around us diesDon't let it dieYou can't let it diePlease don't let it die
