Goodbye Michelle my little oneYou gave me love and helped me find the sunAnd every time theat I was downYou would always come aroundAnd get my feet back on the groundGoodbye Michelle it's hard to dieWhen all the birds are singing in the skyNow that the spring is in the airWith the flowers everywhereI wish that we could both be thereWe had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sunBut the hills that we clim!bed were just seasons out of timeWe had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons have all goneWe had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons have all goneWe had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons have all gone
