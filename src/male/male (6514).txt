I remember all my life　Raining down as cold as iceShadows of a man, a face through a windowCrying in the night, the night goes into morningJust another day, happy people pass my wayLooking in their eyes I see a memoryI never realized how happy you made me Oh MANDYWell you came and you gave without takingBut I sent you away Oh MANDY Well you kissed me and stopped me from shakingAnd I need you today　Oh MANDYI'm standing on the edge of timeI've walked away when love was mineCaught up in a world of uphill climbingThe tears in my eyes　And nothing is rhymingYesterday's a dream　I face the moringCrying on a breeze　The pain is calling
