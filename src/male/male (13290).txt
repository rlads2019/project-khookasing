7:35 I came to life and threw my pants on and Isearched for shoes to fit the groove to get my dance on toTake a ride into down town on main street whereA friend of mine was playing live down at RBC'sBut girl friend is talking so longHogging the bathroom and the phoneThen she had the nerve to say the words that I should click and goAnd don't change mood with attitude and I said...you should talkRight then I knew I blew it　Right then I stepped into itI knew that I would need a drink to get through itShe just turned around and smiled....And then she hit me　And then she hit meWe walked in at half past ten and the place was packedSaw some friends I tried to smile but my face was jackedCut the casualtiesand made a bee line for a barSurprised I made it cause the leash it only goes so far Long Islands in my system　I feel like Sonny ListonBy the second round I was going to town and she was in her coatI said I will find a ride tonight but baby you can goRight then I knew she blew it　I found her drama amusingShe took another drink and must've said screw itAnd she just turned around and smiled....And then she hit me　And then she hit meI know I drive her crazy　I bring out her best and worstIt's not her fault she loves me butIt's all my fault when she gets hurtRight I knew she lost itShe drew line and I crossed itI was drinking like it's water from fausetAnd I just turned around and smiled....And then she hit me　And then she hit meAnd then she hit me
