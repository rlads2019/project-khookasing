Never gonna fall in love againI don't wanna start with someone new'Cause I couldn't bear to see it endJust like me and youNo, I never wanna feel the pain Of remembering how it used to beNever gonna fall in love againJust like you and meAt first we thought that love was here to stayThe summer made it seem so rightBut like the sun we watched it fade awayFrom morning into lonely night
