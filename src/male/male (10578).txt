I get up when I'm down I can't swim but my soul won't drownI do believe I've got flare I've got speed and I walk on air'Cos God gave me his soulin your rock 'n' roll babe'Cos God gave me his soulin your rock 'n' roll babeAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain Running through my veinsYou're my sunshine You're my rainThere's a light That shines on Shines on meAnd it keeps me warmIt give me peaceI must sayI can't sleep 'Cos the world won't wait 'Cos God gave me a soulIn your rock 'n' roll babe 'Cos God gave me a soulIn your rock 'n' roll babeAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain Running through my veinsYou're my sunshine You're my rainAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain Running through my veinsYou're my sunshine You're my rain
