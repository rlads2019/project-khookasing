What goes around comes aroundAnd knocks you senseless to the groundYou regret the words you foundYour voice and your soundOh I know you didn't mean what you saidBut I couldn't help feeling like I was deadDon't want to make believeI'm faceless, nameless in your dreamAh hoo hoo whoaWake up and seek the truthSay I want it to be youAh hoo hoo whoaWe can find like we're right besideAnd try to read between the lines If only we could find a sign to let us know that it was timeIf I were not me and you were not youCould there possibly be a chance for us twoï¼ŸDon't want to make believeI'm faceless, nameless in your dreamAh hoo hoo whoaWake up and seek the truthSay I want it to be youAh hoo hoo whoaDon't want to make believeI'm faceless, nameless in your dreamAh hoo hoo whoaWake up and seek the truthSay I want it to be youAh hoo hoo whoa
