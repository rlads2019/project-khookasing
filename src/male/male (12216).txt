I can feel the weight pullin us both downTogether we can find this gravityI can see the sparkle in your bright eyesAnd I know this is where we beginCause nothing is impossibleThe world is never out of our reachTogether we're unstopableThe ground remains far from our feetFree falling from the skya thousand miles an hourDon't wanna pull the ripcordpull the ripcordI'm not afraid to diejust want to live it louderBefore I pull the ripcordI wanna live today like it's the last oneJust in case tomorrow never comesI wanna give you everything you've dreamed ofAnd I know there will be no regretsCause nothing is impossibleThe world is never out of our reachFree falling from the sky a thousand miles an hourDon't wanna pull the ripcordpull the ripcordI'm not afraid to diejust want to live it louderBefore I pull the ripcordCause nothing is impossibleFree falling from the skya thousand miles an hourDon't wanna pull the ripcordpull the ripcordI'm not afraid to diejust want to live it louderBefore I pull the ripcordFree falling from the skya thousand miles an hourDon't wanna pull the ripcordpull the ripcordI'm not afraid to diejust want to live it louderBefore I pull the ripcordBefore I pull the ripcord
