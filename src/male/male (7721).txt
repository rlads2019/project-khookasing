I heard the music comingfainly thro the wall of an old cafeI was fellin' kinda restlessand drifted t'wars the noiseIt was the end of the dayThro the down, down the hallthe sound I heard thro the wall was getting nearSo I grabbed a sent and ordered a drinkAnd was surpised that they was play'in my favourite thingThey were singing that old unforgetable pistol packin' melodyIt's a true that set me singing and the rhythm they were playingJusta made me want to liveThey were singing that old unforgetable pistol packin' melodyAnd it tingles up a feelin' and setsmy heart a feelin' and it mades me want to liveAnd run homeand write the same kinda thing on my ownThey were singing that old unforgetable pistol packin' melody
