I wake up with the sun in the morningAnd once again I find you're with me and I knowYou're the only one who can help to wake it easySo here we are, you and I, good morning sorrowJust like before I lean on youYou're the one friend who's trueWho needs answers when there's nothing left to sayWhy should I hear it all againHow times easies painWhen nothing can bring back yesterday I wake up with the sun in the morningLeave the phone off the hook so I'm busy all day longThe coffee's growing cold my books lie unopenedHere we are once again good morning sorrow*Just like before I lean on youMy friend you never knewWhat if feels like to be in love this wayMaybe the years will heal the painMaybe I'll even love againBut nothing can bring back yesterday
