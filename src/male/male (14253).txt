It's not my way to love you just when no one's lookingIt's not my way to take your hand if I'm not sureIt's not my way to let you see what's going on inside of meWhen it's love you won't be needing you're not freePlease stop pulling at my sleeve if you're just playingIf you won't take the things you make me want to giveI never cared too much for games and this one's driving me insaneYou're not half as free to wander as you claimBut I'm easyYeah I'm easyGive the word I'll play your gameAs though that's how it ought to be because I'm easyDon't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take meIf loving you would have to be a sometime thingI can't put bars on my insides my love is something I can't hideIt still hurts when I recall the times I tryBut I'm easyYeah I'm easy Take my hand and pull me downI won't put up any fight because I'm easyDon't do me favours let me watch you from a distanceCause when you're near I find it hard to keep my headAnd when your eyes throw light at mine it's enough to change my mindMakes me leave my cautious words and ways behindThat's why I'm easyYeah I'm easySay you want me I'll come running without taking time to thinkCause I'm easyYeah I'm easyTake my hand and pull me downI won't put up any fightBecause I'm easyYeah I'm easyGive the word I'll play your game as though that's how it ought to beBecause I'm easy[中譯]我很隨緣我從不習慣﹐只有在沒有人看到的時候愛妳我從不習慣﹐在不肯定的時候牽著妳的手我從不習慣﹐讓妳看到我內心的感想當妳不需要這份愛時妳並不自由請別拉著我的衣袖﹐如果妳只是在鬧著玩如果妳不會拿去那些妳令我願意付出的東西我從不大熱衷遊戲﹐而這遊戲正令我顛狂妳不能如妳所說般自由流浪但我很隨緣對﹐我很隨緣告訴我妳的希望﹐我會把它來看成玩這遊戲的規則﹐因為我很隨緣請別引導我﹐如果妳根本不會帶我去任何地方如果愛你必須只能是時有時無的我不能將我的思想圈在鋼條內﹐我不能隱藏我的愛當我想起多次的嘗試時依然覺得痛。但我很隨緣對﹐我很隨緣拉著我的手把我拖下我不會抵抗因為我很隨緣不要對我施緩手﹐讓我在遠距離看著妳因為當妳接近我時我很難保持理性妳那雙眼睛對我發放的光芒已足以令我改變注意令我放棄謹慎的言行因此我很隨緣對﹐我很隨緣說妳需要我﹐我會不加思索地奔向妳﹐因為我很隨緣對﹐我很隨緣拉著我的手把我拖下我不會抵抗因為我很隨緣對﹐我很隨緣告訴我妳的希望﹐我會把它來看成玩這遊戲的規則﹐因為我很隨緣
