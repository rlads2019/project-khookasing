When a man loves a womanCan't keep his mind on nothing elseHe'd trade the world for a good thing he's foundIf she's bad, he can't see itShe can do it no wrongTurn his back on his best friendIf he put her downWhen a man loves a womanSpend his very last timeTrying to hold on to what he needsHe'd give up all lover's comfortsAnd sleep out in the rainIf she said that's the way it ought to be When a man loves a womanI'll give you everything I've gotTrying to hold on to your precious loveBaby, baby please don't treat me badWhen a man loves a womanDeep down in his soulShe can bring him such miseryIf she plays him for a foolHe's the last one to knowLoving eyesï¼Œloving eyes can never seeLoving loving loving eyes never seeWhen a man loves a woman
