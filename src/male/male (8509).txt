Tonight I'll write a letterPut it in a bottle and hope that it'll find youDelivered by the arms of the tide'Cause I just can't forget youLorelei, Lorelei, sweet LoreleiThey call you Lorelei, siren of the seaYou haunt me with a song out of the deepOh I was victim to your sorceryLed me straight to miseryLike a sailor lost overboardOh, oh, oh, oh, I can't take anymoreOh I was tempted by your burning lips Trapped inside your sweet caressWhile you kept on dragging me downDrowin' in my tearsSometimes I still wonder whyLoreleiThe storm beats at my windowEvery time the thunder startsFeel the pounding of my heartThink I hear your voice in the windThe rain it wets my pillowLorelei, Lorelei, sweet LoreleiThey call you Lorelei, siren of the seaNo, I can't break the spell you cast on me
