Well crcodile rocking something shockingMarkes your feet just can't keep stillNever know me a better timeAnd I guess I never willOh lawdy mama friday nightWhen Suzie wore her dresses tight Crocodile rocking was out of sightLa......La......La......La......When the years went by and rock just diedSuzie went and left a foreing guyLong nights crying by the record machineDreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeansBut they never killed the shrills we gotWhen they up to the crocodile rockLearning fast as the weeks went pastWe really thought the crocodile rock would last
