Dreaming ,I must be dreamingOr am I really lying here with youBaby , you take me in your armsAnd though u am wide awakeI know my dream is coming trueAnd though I just fall in love againJust one touch an then it happens every time And there I goI just fall in love againAnd when I doI can't help myself I fall in love with youMagic , it must be magicThe way I hold you and the night just seem to flyEasy , for you to take me to a starHeaven is that moment when I look in your eyes
