Windflowers,my father told me not to go near them.He said he feared them always,and he told me that they carried himaway.Windflowers,Beautiful windflowers I couldn't wait to touch them,to smell them I held them closely.And now I cannot break away.Their sweet bouquet disappears like the vapor in the desert.So take a warning,son.Windflowers,Ancient windflowers.Their beauty captures every young dreamer who lingers near them.But ancient windflowers,I love you.
