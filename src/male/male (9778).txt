'Tis the season now　For gifts and giving allThe love our hearts　And dreams can affordAnd when I think about you　The hope that you've handed outI want to give back all I have　And then some moreBut I'm only human　I can only do so muchBut all the miracles we need　Is just one touch,just one touch(Chorus)From me from you　Helping someone who can't make it on their own No one wants to be alone at a time like this　Only joy should existWhen the world gets too much　All we need, all we need is a touch of loveWhen hard times appear　When we drown in our tearsThere's faith enough to see us through　Whatever rains on usWe can always trust That heaven's hand will guide us throughYeah we're only human　But we can all do so muchAll the miracles we need　Is just one touchYeah just one touch　(Chorus)　It took a child t touch the worldJust think what we can do　Think of the miracles
