When I wake up in the morning loveAnd the sunlight hurts my eyesAnd something without warning loveBears heavy on my mindThen I look at youAnd the world's alright with meJust one look at youAnd I know it's gonna beA lovely dayLovely day, lovely day, lovely day When the day that lies ahead of meSeems impossible to faceWhen someone else instead of meAlways seems to know the wayThen I look at youAnd the world's alright with meJust one look at youAnd I know it's gonna beA lovely day A lovely day A lovely day A lovely day
