We had it allJust like bogey and macallStaring in a own, let it showSailing away to key largoHere's locking at you kid Missing all the things we didWe can find it once again I knowJust like they did in key largoHoney can't you remember wellplaying all the partsThat sweet scene of surrenderWhen you gave me your heartPlease say you willPlay it againCause I love you stillMaybe this can't be the end
