If I wsa the north wind would you stop and shoot the breezeAnd if I was a mirror you would get close as you could beIf I was a candle would you hold me gentlyBut if I was to love youOh, you would run away from me(yes you would)The water in the most was high to help protect the queenAnd I was on the other side with a drawbridge in betweenI waited at the gate but you were never to be seenAnd bridges burn much easier if you'er using kerosene(Heh, heh, heh...)(chorus)And i would hold my ownJust to ascend that throneThough all my friends at home tell me I'mBetter off aloneAnd all the tales you toldAbout true love got oldCause in the end you showed me how your Love was so, so cold, baby......owSeven days a week I call you just to hear you say:' Boy, I've got a thing for you but there really is no way. 'Even so I know you love me more and more each dayYou tell me I'm the only one when your boyfriend is away(oh no)(chorus)And i would hold my ownJust to ascend that throneThough all my friends at home tell me I'mBetter off aloneAnd all the tales you toldAbout true love got oldCause in the end you showed me how yourLove was so, so cold, baby......owI don't know what I was thinking, I should've listened toyou guys but I promise that the next tinme...I'll never let...Better off alone Don't wanna be alone
