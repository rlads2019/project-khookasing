He takes you outAnd he takes you upCos' he can show you so muchI go to bed and tomorrow againThere's a lot of work to be doneHe gives you goldAnd he'll promise youThe whole world will be yoursI just can tell you I love you soEven though my odds are low(Anyway) I'm not an actorI'm not a starAnd I don't even have my own car But I'm hoping so much you'll stayThat you will love me anywayThe dirty games and the neon showsThis is the world he knowsWatching the starsSatisfies my soulThinking of himMakes me feel so coldThe fancy cars and the restaurantsYou're just so fond of the manSometimes I wonder if you are blindCan't you seeHe's got dirt on his mind
