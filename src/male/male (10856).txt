You were a temptation I could not resist the baitNow I look around me and I find there's no escapeI am like a fly caught up in a black widow's webHelp meWhat a fool I was not to have seen through your disguiseBut your beauty blinded me it took me by surpriseI should have known better than tolisten to your pretty alibisI had a notion to taste the potion of love you gave meNow that it's too late how well I seeLove's a tender trap But there's to turnin' backNo no not for me I'm a victim of your sweet deception And now I can't break freeLove's a tender trap But there's no turnin' backI fell in too deepDown, down, I'm sinkin' downHelp me, help me, help meLove is a trapWhen I heard you calling I just couldn't help myselfI knew I was falling but it seemed like someone elseYou sneaked up behind pushed me right on over the edgeHelp meYou know I still love you though you treat me like you doHow can you just stand there Oh how can you be so cruelYou know you can save meBut you lock the door and throw away the key
