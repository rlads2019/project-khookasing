I see trees are green, red roses, tooI see them bloom for me and youAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldI see skies of blue and clouds of whiteThe bright blessed dayThe dark sacred nightAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldThe colors of the rainbow So pretty in the skyAre also on the faces of people going byI see friends shaking handsSaying 'how do you do?'They're really saying I love youI hear babies cry, I watch them growThey learn much moreThan I'll never knowAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful world
