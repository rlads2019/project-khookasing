There's a place I know fairly well.It's a home away from home.Get you down to the silver bell.We'd like to have it known.If you don't know the game by now.You'd be better off alone.Take a walk down the hall of hearts.You know the seeds been sown.You can pass the pitcher by the corner stone.Watch the innings fade into the day. wo. wo. wo.Say hello to love, give my best to baby.Find someone to look the other way.We can fall in love awhile. Call it what you may.Take a frown and give a smile.I think i'll stay.There's that funny old lady.Maybe I'll just give her a callHave some fun and chase the sunin the sunday fapers,from our long lost friendwe all know she loves it like her child wo,wo,woSay hello to heidi, ayi di ayi diWe all have our moments from awhileMove along the waiting line of lovershold their names and faces with a smile.wo,wo,wosay good-bye my ladygive my best to babywe all have our moments for awhile.
