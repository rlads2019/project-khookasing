Love is a mystery to meShe was once here,and now she's someonethat I could not bearNo matter how I tried 'til the day I diedDamages are done and hidden withinThose were the things that were hidden under my skin日 曬在眉梢 夜 染在唇角即使可素臉 可找到替身繼續 渴望年輕 並 渴望前看往事沒言語 在皮下呼吸要到哪裡 會碰不到故人要在哪片大鏡中發現我沒有遺憾從沒有拋不開的一種吻 難以過去的叫靈魂能藏下多少的親愛 想不到哪段最吸引在大笑後哭泣 熟悉過然後陌生但並未陌路 在皮膚碰面 是皺紋All the burning rosesFilled up with ashes Crying out loud but no time for condolencesLike a stranger's 'stare', she never caredThose were the things that were hidden under my skin願 快樂如一 若 美麗殘缺歲月極微細 從皮上滲入要到哪裡 見每一個故人要在哪片大鏡中炫耀我沒法再生從沒有拋不開的一種吻 難以過去的叫靈魂能藏下多少的親愛 想不到哪段最吸引在大笑後哭泣 熟悉過然後陌生但並未陌路 在皮膚碰面 是皺紋從沒有拋不開的一種吻 誰已老去都有靈魂能藏下多少的相信 可相信以後更吸引未做到亦一生 或者我才是陌生但並未陌路 在皮膚碰面 是皺紋Drifting alone, on my ownBe it a car or a shooting starIts glare finally came to the end of somethingI could not bearThose were the things that were hidden under my skin
