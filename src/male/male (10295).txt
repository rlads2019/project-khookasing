You have given me lovebeyond border linesMended broken pieces of me long left behindAnd if I knew it meant your happiness would be assuredI'd scale the tallest mountainside and walk the ocean floorThe impossible is possible as I am yoursAnd if I had my wayTime would stop tomorrow Forever and a dayIs not enough to share with youNo less than you deserveI promise I will give youMore than just my wordI'll give you my world , I'll give you my worldNow As we all must let the force of fate decideI will bear no regret with you here by my side When the hour is at hand that I must say goodbyeI will gladly meet my end knowing well that IFound in you the greatest happiness of all my lifeAnd if I had my wayTime would stop tomorrowForever and a dayIs not enough to share with youNo less than you deserveI promise I'll give youMore than just my wordI'll give you my worldMore than just my wordI'll give you my worldI'll give you my worldI'll give you my world
