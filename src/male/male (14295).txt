你住的巷子裡　我租了一間公寓Along the alley where you stayed, I rented a place there為了想與你不期而遇All I wished was to meet you by chance高中三年　我為什麼　為什麼不好好讀書Three years in high school, why didn't I, why didn't I study harder?沒考上跟你一樣的大學And get into the same university as you?我找了份工作　離你宿舍很近I found a job, closer to the place you stay當我開始學會做蛋餅　才發現你不吃早餐When I started learning to make egg pancake rolls, then I realized that you don't have breakfast喔　你又擦肩而過Oh, you walked past me again你耳機聼什麼　能不能告訴我Could you tell me what songs you were listening to in your earphone?躺在你學校的操場看星空Lying on your school field, Staring at the starry sky教室裡的燈　還亮著你沒走The light in the classroom was still on, you've not left記得我寫給你的情書Remembering the love letters that I've written for you都什麼年代了　到現在我還在寫著What time is it now? I can't believe I'm still writing them總有一天　總有一年　會發現Someday, you will realize有人默默的陪在你的身邊That someone is quietly staying right by your side也許我不該在你的世界Maybe I don't belong to your world當你收到情書　也代表我已經走遠The moment you receive those letters would mean that I have left you far away 學校旁的廣場　我在這等鐘聲響At the square beside your school, I waited for the bell to ring等你下課一起走好嗎After class, can I wait for you to walk home together彈著琴　唱你愛的歌　暗戀一點都不痛苦Playing the guitar, singing your favorite song, I did not suffer because of this secret admiration痛苦的是你根本沒看我What kills me is that you didn't even look at me我唱這麼走心　卻走不進你心裡I sang from my heart, but just couldn't get into your heart在人來人往找尋著你　守護著你不求結局Searching for you among the crowds, guarding you all this while, and expecting nothing in return喔　你又擦肩而過Oh, you walked past me again我唱告白氣球　終於你回了頭You finally looked back at me when I sang 「Love Confession」躺在你學校的操場看星空Lying on your school field, Staring at the starry sky教室裡的燈　還亮著你沒走The light in the classroom was still on, you've not left記得我寫給你的情書Remembering the love letters that I've written for you都什麼年代了　到現在我還在寫著What time is it now? I can't believe I'm still writing them總有一天　總有一年　會發現Someday, you will realize有人默默的陪在你的身邊That someone is quietly staying right by your side也許我不該在你的世界Maybe I don't belong to your world當你收到情書　也代表我已經走遠The moment you receive those letters would mean that I have left you far away
