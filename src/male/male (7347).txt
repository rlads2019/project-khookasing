I wish you bluebirds in the springTo give your heart a song to singAnd then a kiss, but more than thisI wish you loveAnd in July a lemonadeTo cool you in some leafy gladeI wish you healthAnd more than wealthI wish you loveMy breaking heart and I agreeThat you and I could never beSo with my bestMy very bestI set you freeI wish you shelter from the stormA cozy fire to keep you warm But most of all when snowflakes fallI wish you loveMy breaking heart and I agreeThat you and I could never beSo with my bestMy very bestI set you freeI wish you shelter from the stormA cozy fire to keep you warmBut most of all when snowflakes fallI wish you loveBut most of all when snowflakes fallI wish you love
