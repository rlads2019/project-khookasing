You and I moving in the darkBodies close but souls apartShadowed smiles and secrets unrevealedI need to know the way you feelI'll give you everything I amAnd everything I want to beI'll put it in your handsIf you could open up to me ohCan't we ever get beyond this wall'Cause all I want is just onceTo see you in the lightBut you hide behindThe color of the night I can't go on running from the pastLove has torn away this maskAnd now like clouds, like rainI'm drowning and I blame it all on youI'm lost, god save meEverything I amAnd everything I want to be yourCan't we ever get beyond this wallCause all I want is just onceForever and againI'm waiting for you, I'm standing in the lightBut you hide behind the color of the light
