You asked me what I want you asked me what I needIt's nothing you can buy my heart's not ruled by greedI don't give diamond diamonds you see throughI want you to hold me I want you to be trueGive me the gift of love　Look me in the eysSay I'm the oneyou're dreaming ofThat would be the best surpriseGive me the gift of your sweet loveIn the light of the day　In the dark of nightLike the colours of the sun the feelings in your heartIt's all I want from you and whne the sky is darkI'll have you beside me, who could ask for moreI'll just wear a smile when you walk in the door
