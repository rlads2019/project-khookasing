* Nobody gets too much heaven no moreIt's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in lineNobody gets too much love any moreIt's as high (wide) as a mountain (river) and harder to climb *Oh, you and me, girl, got a lot of love in storeAnd it flows through you and it flows through meAnd I love you so much more than my lifeI can see beyond foreverEverything we are will never die** Loving's such a beautiful thingOh, you make my world a summer day Are you just a dream to fade away **(Repeat *)Oh, you and me, girl, got a highway to the skyWe can turn away from the night and dayAnd the tears we had to cry, you're my lifeI can see a new tomorrowEverything we are will never dieLoving's such a beautiful thingWhen you are to me the light aboveThere for all to see our precious love(Repeat * and ** then * to fade)
