Once I never thought loveI found you like I did loveI came out of the rain and fell into your eyesAnd I realize my love is coming close to meSo I want to give All my love to you＊Now I wonder how your Fell about the way I love youDo you miss me as I miss you in my dreamsWaking up and see your smilling face in front of me Want to send my love all My life to you＃Tell me where do we go from hereOh my love I want you always near me everydayLove is here to stayNow that all of my dreams came trueThere is one more thing I need to say isHow I love you Oh I really love you from me to youRepeat ＊,＃　＃
