The road is long with many a winding turnthat leads us to who knows where, who knows whereBut I'm strong, strong enough to carry himHe ain't heavy He's my brotherSo on we go, his welfare is my concernNo burden is he to bear, we'll get thereFor I know he would not encumber meHe ain't heavy He's my brother laden at all, I'm laden with sadnessthat everyone's heart isn't filledwith the gladness of love for one anotherIt's long long roadfrom while there is no returnWhile we're on our way to therewhy not shareï¼ŸAnd the load doesn't weigh me down at allHe ain't heavy He's my brother
