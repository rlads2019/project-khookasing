In my bedroom trying to chase the dreamAll my mates are getting wastedDisregarded almost everythingSpent all my time trying to make itThe little moments seem to pass me byI just forgot my girlfriend's birthdaySo she went and got another guyThat she met at universityAnd I might be highBut it's clear in my mindEverything I want is waiting to be found Yeah it's crying outSo I aint gonna slow down slow downI'm not gonna waste a day waiting for things to changeWhen everything I want is waiting to be foundI won't slow down slow downNo I aint gonna slow down slow downCuz if you're not giving it all you're not giving nothing at allAnd everything you want is waiting to be foundSo don't slow down slow downNo I don't mean to patronizeEverybody's got their own pathSee me I'm aiming for the skiesGotta make it while the light lastsAnd I might be high But it's clear in my mindEverything I want is waiting to be foundYeah it's crying out crying outSo I aint gonna slow down slow downI'm not gonna waste a day waiting for things to changeWhen everything I want is waiting to be foundI won't slow down slow downNo I aint gonna slow down slow downCuz if you're not giving it all you're not giving nothing at allAnd everything you want is waiting to be foundSo don't slow down slow downEveryday there's these pages in my mindAnd they're filled up with waysTo turn riddles into rhymes oh I can't stopI'm waiting for that penny dropSo I aint gonna slow down slow downI'm not gonna waste a day waiting for things to changeWhen everything I want is waiting to be foundI won't slow down slow downNo I aint gonna slow down slow downCuz if you're not giving it all you're not giving nothing at allEverything you want is waiting to be foundSo don't slow down slow down
