Streets of BerlinI must leave you soonAh!Will you forget me?Was I really here?Find me a bar,On the cobblestoned streetsWhere the boys are pretty.I can not loveFor more than one dayBut one day is enough in this city. Find me a boyWith two ocean blue eyesAnd show him no pity.Take out his eyesHe never needs to seeHow they eat you alive in this city.Streets of BerlinI must leave you soonStreets of BerlinDo you care?Streets of BerlinWill you cry outIf I vanishinto thin air? 感謝    修正歌詞
