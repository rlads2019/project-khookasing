Mirror shows me the mask that I've been wearing.Whose echo echo speaks after I speak?And all this time, whose lines have I been saying?Whose footprints are these that follow me?All I was...Forgot. Who I was... I'm not.Try to be like idle idols I know I know.We are made of two. Which one is really you?What should I say, or think, or do, I don't know. Pretend to be, pretending not to be.Whose shadow is this that is under me?Whose burden is this the one that I'm carrying?Whose name do they call? Are they calling me?Who I was...Forgot. All I am... I'm not.Try to be like idle idols I know I know.I am made of three. Which one is really me?What should I see, or hear, or speak, I don't know.
