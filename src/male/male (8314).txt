All my everythingThere's nothing that can harm youIn the lonely nightI'll come to youAnd keep you safe and warmIt's so strong my loveWhen I kiss your lipsI feel the rolling thunderTo my fingertipsAnd all the While my head is in a spinDeep within I'm in loveWhen I kiss your lipsI live up on the landAnd see the sky aboveI swim within her oceanSweet and warm There's no storm my loveYou're my everythingAnd nothing really mattersBut the love you bringYou're my everythingTo see you in the morningWith those big brown eyesYou're my everythingForever and a dayI need you close to meYou're my everythingYou never have to worry never fearFor I am nearAll my everythingI live up on the land and see the sky aboveI swim within her ocean sweet and warmThere's no storm my love
