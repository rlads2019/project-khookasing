Tonight you say,that I'm your only one,You caress me tender,Until the morning comes,The sound of your whisper,Ringin' inside my ear,I want to hear those same sweet words next year ooh~~~Change：So many lovers, other lovers came and goneMakin' promises forever only till the　next one comes along(Chorus)So why don't you tell me,This time next year,Will you still love me true,Or will I be losing you,Why don't tell me,This time next year, After all the ups and downs,Are you gonna be around,Don't ever leave me,Don't ever go away,Just tell me I got nothin' to fear,Baby this time next year.I love you so with all of my heart and soul,Don't wanna lose you,Don't want this love so grow old,Not much am I askin',All I want is you,I feel you inside my heart,With every little thing you do.
