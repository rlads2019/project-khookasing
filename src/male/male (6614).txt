Lady can you hear my heart ofã€€passionKnocking at your sensesCan you see my eyes of sorrowCasting tear drops on your shadowAnd I don't want to let goYou make me feet like a little boyWho holds so tightly on his toyYou make me feel like a grown-up manWho finally wakes me up and understandsAnd I don't want to let go It's so warm a feeling when I'mHere within your sightBut I'm so frightened with the mysteriesIn your eyesAre they something in my lifeOf unsung melodyOr are they leading to some hidden historyOh, what a shame and what a pityI'm just a mediocratyBut then againI love you with your beautiful humanityMakes me blue, and then I love you
