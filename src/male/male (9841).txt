When there's someone else who caresWhen there's someone home who's waiting just for meEver now I think about you as I'm climbing up the stairsAnd I wonder what to do so she won't seeThat ever nowWhen I've found a better life than what we hadEver now I wake up crying in the middle of the nightAnd I can't believe it still could hurt so badEver nowWhen I have come so forI wonder where you areI wonder why it's still so hard without youEver nowWhen I come shining throughI swear I think for youAnd now I wish you know Ever nowEver nowWhen I never hear your nameAnd the world has changed so much since you're been goneEver nowI still remember and the feeling's still the sameAnd this pain inside of me goes on and onEver nowWhen I have come so forI wonder where you areI wonder why it's still so hard without youEver nowWhen I come shining throughI swear I think for youAnd now I wish you knowSome howEver now
