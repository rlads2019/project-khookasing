I'm about to go off like a gunshotI wanna make you drip like a sweatshopI'm about to make sounds that you never heardI'm gonna take your locks and break them withthe keys in your hand and a microphone in mineMan, it makes me high (It makes me high)Lifts me to the sky (Yeah, yeah...)Love is just a lie (It's just a lie) What made me so high? (What made me so...)I have got, to admit, this homeboy, he won't quitMakin' beats, talkin' shit, spittin' fast, keepin' fitSession file, 24 bit, on the stage, is where I'm litAll my fans, freakin' it, jumpin' round, 'cause they don't sit(They don't sit you all)I'm talkin' bout body surfin', hands wavin' booties jerkin'Some may dabble in the fountain of funk but as for usWe're already swimming in it!!!!!
