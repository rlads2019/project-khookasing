靜聽手錶一分一秒在顫抖　問我為何存在世上像分針拚搏如常地每晚每日工作　倦了麼　然而又再泛起你哼的那句歌DON'T NEED TO FEAR DON'T NEED TO CRYDON'T NEED TO WORRY I WILL BE THERE每當我倦了　看不見　我未來　視線沒法打開　流淚前還是記起 DON'T NEED TO FEAR DON'T NEED TO CRYDON'T NEED TO WORRY I WILL BE THERE也許長路裡　有這麼　一個人　便而無悔這生　這友情能伴我TOGETHER TOGETHER TOGETHER....WOO TOGETHER TOGETHER TOGETHER WITH YOU
