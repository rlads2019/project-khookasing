Everyday is like Christmas dayWith you in my armsGetting cozy in Santa's sleighYou to keep me warmUnderneath that big green treeThe stars shine downIt's so heavenly ohEveryday is Like Christmas dayWhen you're with meEveryday song is Christmas songHear the angels singAnd when you kiss me I sing alongJust hear the bells ringIn the spirit of good cheerThey chime so magicallyAll can hear thatEveryday song is a Christmas songWith you my dear* Everyday is ChristmasEveryday is ChristmasI may be naiveBut I do believeThat reindeer fly on ChristmasEve Cause Santa heBrought you here to me * Everywhere that we look aroundIt's startin' to snowAnd when you hold me with youI've foundAll I need to knowHiding in this spot'bow the chimneytopsWatchin'Santa Claus make his stops ohWe're so happy with what we're gotLet's let it rock* Everyday is ChristmasEveryday is ChristmasI may be naiveBut I do believeThat reindeer fly on ChristmasEve Cause Santa heBrought you here to me *Cause Santa heBrought you here to meEveryday is like Christmas dayWith you in my armsGetting cozy in Santa's sleighYou to keep me warmUnderneath that big green treeThe stars shine downIt's so heavenly ohEveryday is Like Christmas dayWhen you're with me
