I believe that love has goneHad no strength to carry onThought me world was upside downThen you walked onto my lifeWent to work to set things rightWhat's the secret that you that you usedYou made me believe in magicYou know that I can be true to your loveYou made me believe in magic Your love put magic into my lifeNow I'm filled with a new sense to beYou gave my life harmonyLovin' you will all I, all I needYou made me believe in magicYou know that I can be true to your loveYou made me believe in magicYour love put magic into my life
