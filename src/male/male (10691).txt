I haven't seen my Baby in so longBut I can feel her in this songI turn on the stereo, the groove is nice and slowIf only she was here to dance alongI write her letters every single dayThere's only so much words can sayWe'll be together soon. I'm dancin' in my roomImagining you're not so far awayAnd I dream, againYou're right by my sideYou're back in my arms againA feeling so sublimeSo I dream, againYour beautiful smileWhen we're dancin' cheek to cheekAcross a thousand miles yeah My baby hasn't seen me in so longAnd she knows I'd never do her wrongShe turns on the stereo, the Stevie tunes I knowWishing I was there to dance alongAnd she dreams, againI'm right by her sideI'm back in her arms againA feeling so sublimeSo she dreams, againOf hearing the soundOf sweet nothings last at nightWith no one else around yeahAnd when the night is overThe loneliness is throughI know in my heart that you're my everythingI'll never love anotherAs long as I have youSo tell me that we can last forever
