I've been so many places in my life and timeI've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymeI've acted out my life in stagesWith ten thousand people watching meBut we're alone now and I'm singing this song for youI know your image of me is what I hope to beI've treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you seeThere's no one more important to meBaby, can't you please see through meCause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for youYou taught me precious secretsThe truth, with holding nothingYou came out in front and I was hiding But now I'm so much betterAnd if my words don't come togetherListen to the melody cause my love is in there hidingI love you in a place where there is no space or timeI love you for my life, you're a friend of mineAnd when my life is over, remember when we were togetherWe were alone and I was singing the song for youI love you in a place where there is no space or timeI love you for my life, you're a friend of mineAnd when my life is over, remember when we were togetherWe were alone and I was singing the song for youWe were alone and I was singing my songSinging my song for youSinging my song
