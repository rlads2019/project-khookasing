Loving me, and I know thatI need nothing moreLove above the loveI've known beforeA breath a life to fill my heartWith no such place as far apartYou are a night of love, an island You are a night of love, an islandYou are the shining and the starAnd when I'm sure I've gone too farI turned around and there you areLoving me loving you loving meThere are words to say this rightYou are the morning in the lightYou are a night of love, an islandYou are the shining and the starAnd when I'm sure I've gone too farI turned around and there you areLoving me loving youLoving me loving you loving me....
