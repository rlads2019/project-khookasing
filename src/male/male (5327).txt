(純音樂)Lyrics：雷頌德Music：雷頌德Arranger：雷頌德I can't believe I could be the oneTo be with you under the morning sunSee the moon and the nightingaleSing along with us Oh baby babyYou're the only oneFills my fantasy roomNever gonna stop All that fantasyI'll live my liveI'll live my live for you* Thank you for loving me babyYou'll always be the one who drives me crazyI think this is a gift from god to have you hereThank you for loving me babyI'll treasure all your love and all the thing we shareAnd I wanna tell youHow much I love you *Repeat once *
