Shining like an angel flyingHeaven burning my loveNever gonna have you leave meHeaven on fire burning loveSharing pretty nights. Hold me till I dieFalling in love is so sweetOh- Flying like the dustWhat kind of fool am IBurning love Walking on lonely streets in a darkened nightMidnight sun rolling down my eyeLiving in a forest of fallen dreamslife's just a big hand strangling me still I dieBut your giving fand rising up to my heartSo keep the fire burning my loveFeeling your heat burningmakes my boby temperature riseHeaven on fire. Shining like an angel flyingHeaven burning my loveNever gonna have you leave meHeaven on fire burning loveSharing pretty nights.
