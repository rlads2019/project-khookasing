Can this be real?Can this be true?Am I the person I was this morning?And are you the same you?Its all so strangeHow can it be?All along this love was right in front of meAnd for the first time, I am looking in your eyesFor the first time, I am seeing who you are I can't believe how much I seeWhen you're looking back at meNow I understand what love is...Love is...For the first timeSuch a long time agoI had given up on finding this emotionEver againBut you're here with me nowYes I found you somehowAnd I've never been so sureFor the first time, I am looking in your eyesFor the first time, I'm seeing who you areCan't believe how much I seeWhen you're looking back at meNow I understand what love is...Love is...For the first timeFor the first time
