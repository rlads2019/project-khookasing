What do you get when you fall in loveA diamond pin to burst your bubbleThat's what you get for all your troubleI'll never fall in love againI'll never fall in love againWhat do you get when you kiss a girlYou get enough germs to catch pneumoniaAfter you do she'll never phone youI'll never fall in love againI'll never fall in love againDon't tell me what it's all aboutCause I've been there and I'm glad I'm outOut of those chains those chains that bind youThat is why I'm here to remind you What do you get when you give your heartYou get it all broken up and batteredThat's what you get a heart that's shatteredI'll never fall in love againI'll never fall in love againOut of those chains those chains that bind youThat is why I'm here to remind youWhat do you get when you fall in loveYou only get lies and pain and sorrowSo for at least until tomorrowI'll never fall in love againI'll never fall in love againI'll never fall in love again
