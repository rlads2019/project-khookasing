I saw an old friend of ours today 　 He asked about youI didn't quite know what to sayHeard you been makin' the rounds round hereWhile I've been tryin' to make tears disappear* Now I'm almost over you 　 I've almost shook these bluesSo when you come back around 　 After painting the townYou'll see I'm almost over youYou're such a sly one with your cold , cold heartMaybe leavin' came easy 　 But it tore me apart Time heals all wounds , they sayAnd I should know 'cause it seemsLike forever but I lettin' you go 　 ( Repeat * )I can't forgive you and soon I'llForget all the shattered dreamsAll though you left me with nothing to showFull of misery 　 ( Repeat * )When you come back around 　 After painting the townYou'll see I'm almost over you
