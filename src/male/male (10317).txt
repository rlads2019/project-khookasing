No more wine and rosesAn open door that closesWhere's the joy and laughterWhere's forever afterAnd I know the way I feel insideThe way I hide behind my prideAny fool could see what I've been throughI cry a lot behind my smileAnd hope that in a little whileThe next voice that I hear belongs to youLearning to forget youForget I ever met youMemories that haunt youCrying out I want youSuddenly I can't replace the smile I wore upon my faceI only feel a love that's been denied And had I known it from the startI would have saved my broken heartBut now I couldn't save it if I triedI gave it all to youI counted on foreverUntil the day you said goodbyeI gave all my love to youUntil the day you said goodbyeI dreamed we'd go on foreverUntil the day you said goodbyeI believed we'd belong togetherUntil the day you said goodbyeMy love, have the roses died?They died the day you said goodbyeAfter all, all the roses diedThey died the day you said goodbyeOoh...
