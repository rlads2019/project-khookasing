Once this was our favorite placeOnce we'd often come on a dateAnd we'd sit watching the shipsSail into the evening mistYou would always smile like a childAs you'd look out at the beautiful lightsAnd you'd say maybe somedayYou would sail awayWhere are you now, my loveI can't help but think about youI sit alone each nightAnd look at the lightsDreamin' of times How it used to beWhere are you now, my loveI just can't go on without youAll alone since you've goneAcross the seaWhere are you nowOnce the harbor lights held a charmOnce I held you close in my armsAnd we'd dream as lover's dreamOf the places we would seeNow alone in our favorite placeI can't wipe the tears from my faceAs the sun begins to setOn another dayMusic
