Everything that you are And everything that you doFills me with hope and love I want you to know that I love youThoughts of you fill my mind And brighten up every dayMy dreams of a perfect love Coming true in so many waysAnd I know I can't be wrong To say that together we belongAnd think of the times We've seen each other throughTell me if the song Should ever get weary or too longThat everyghing will calm As long as I have youYour kisses are just like sumshine Melting away the winter snow andSuddenly life awakens Reminding me you're the best woman I knowAnd I know I can't be wrong To say that together we belongAnd think of the times We've seen each other througtTell me if the song Should ever get weary or too longThat everything will calm As long as I have you
