I can't stay, yes I knowYou know I hate to goBut goodbye, love was sweetOur worlds can never meetSo I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you soAnd I'll die just a little 'cause I have to goAway Verse 2:Can't you see how I feelWhen I say love's unrealBut goodbye, it's been sweetEven though incomplete[repeat chorus]Instrumental break:Verse 3:Every night I still hearAll your sighs very clearNow love's gone, gone awayAs I once heard you sayChorus 2:Now I've cried just a little 'cause I loved you soAnd I've died just a little 'cause I had to goAway[repeat instrumental break]
