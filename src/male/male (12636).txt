Remember when I was youngerThinking bout all the fancy thingsDreaming bout what I'll becomeAnd all my foolish fantasiesNow that I look backThey seem to me so funnyBut every timeI close my eyesI wanna run awayWanna go back to that placeWhere we can share our feelingsI think I still gotA place forAll my dreams and fantasiesEven though I may beToo late for anythingWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsStill got passion in my bloodstreamHope I'm not too lateWanna make a changeDon't want to waste my life awayWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsLife is filled with surpriseI just wanna do the things I like I wanna run awayWanna go back to that placeWhere we can share our feelingsI think I still gotA place forAll my dreams and fantasiesEven though I may beToo late for anythingWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsStill got passion in my bloodstreamHope I'm not too lateWanna make a changeDon't want to waste my life awayWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsLife is filled with surpriseI just wanna do the things I likeWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsStill got passion in my bloodstreamHope I'm not too lateWanna make a changeDon't want to waste my life awayWanna chase my dreamsAll the fancy thingsLife is filled with surpriseI just wanna do the things I like
