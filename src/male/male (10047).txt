A quiet man of musicdenied a simpler fateHe tried to be a soldier oncebut his music wouldn't waitHe earned his love through disciplinea thundering, velvet handHis gentle means of sculpting soulstook me years to understand***The leader of the band is tiredand his eyes are growing oldBut his blood runs through my instrumentand his son is in my soulMy life has been a poor attemptto imitate the manI'm just a living legacyto the leader of the band ***My brothers' lives were differentfor they heard another callOne went to Chicagoand the other to St. PaulAnd I'm in Coloradowhen I'm not in some hotelLiving out this life I've chosenand come to know so wellI thank you for the musicand your stories of the roadI thank you for the freedomwhen it came my time to goI thank you for the kindnessand the time when you got toughAnd papa I don't think I said'I love you' near enoughREPEAT ***I am a living legacyto the leader of the band
