Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?You been out ridin'　fences for so long now.Oh, you're a hard one,but I know that you've got your reasons.These things that are pleasin' youcan hurt you somehow.Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy!She'll beat you, if she's able.You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.Now it seems to me some fine thingshave been laid upon your table,but you only want the ones that you can't get.Desperado, ah, you ain't gettin' no younger.Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home. Freedom, oh, freedom. That's just some people talkin'Your prison is walking through this world all alone.Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine.It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day.You're losin'　all your highs and lows.Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?Come down from your fences, open the gate.It may be rainin' , but there's a rainbow above you.You better let somebody love you (2x)before it's too late.[中譯]亡命之徒為何你不清醒一點你築起城牆把自己圍起來已經很久了噢！你真是個固執的傢伙我明白你一定有你的理由但那些令你歡欣的事情總有一天會傷害你你不拿走方塊皇后那張牌嗎？它將會把你擊垮紅心皇后一直是你最好的一張牌我心目中的好牌都已攤開在你的面前但你卻只要那些得不到的亡命之徒你已不再年輕你的苦痛，你的飢餓它們正催促你的歸來自由啊！自由那只是一般人的說法獨自行走天涯就是你的囚籠冬日裡，你的雙腳不覺得寒冷嗎？天空不下雪，太陽也不照耀分辨不出白天或黑夜你已一無所有這種失去的感覺很可笑吧亡命之徒你為何還不清醒一點走下你的城牆，打開大門外面也許下著雨但彩虹就在你的頭頂上你最好讓別人愛你你最好讓別人愛你在為時已晚之前
