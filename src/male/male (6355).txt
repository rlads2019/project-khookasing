Pack my bag and lock the doorI can hardly waitCatch a taxi, catch a starI'll be on my wayI know I'm going in the right directionOn a big jetliner in the skyCarrying me straight to my dreamLove won't pass me byThis crazy heart has got to flyFly away, fly awayGot my ticket, got my flight Got my gypsy shoesGonna leave my blues behindMake my dream come trueCheck-in counter, through the gateWill she wait for meDown the runway can't be lateShe's the one I needI don't know what'll happen when I get thenBut I'll never rest until I tryLettin' her know, I love her soLove won't pass me byThis crazy heart has got to flyFly away, fly away
