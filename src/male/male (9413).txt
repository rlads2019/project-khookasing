Standing on a mountainI could hear the wind speaks as it loveGrandpa said to me it's the voices of ourHeroes bringing joy to our livesThey make everything alright but they've gone away too soonThe are riding in the wind*(I'm)standing on a mountainCounting stars with children high up in the skyAnd I tell them, its the eyes our heroesShining bright for you to seeSo that you can be freeBut they've gone away too soon The are riding in the wind*they are blessing our childrenThey are blessing our nationThey touched the hearts of you and IThey are blessing our childrenThey are blessing our nationI'll remember them as heroesWhose spirits touched and brighten up our lifesRepeat *#(they're) using the power of love to make the world a better place for youAnd meOh, and now we're happy and oh so freeWe must open up our hearts and never to forget our heroesRepeat ##
