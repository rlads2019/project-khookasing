I'll never let you seeThe way my broken heart is hurting meI've got my pride and I know how to hideAll my sorrow and painI'll do my crying in the rainIf I wait for cloudy skiesYou won't know the rain from the tears in my eyesYou'll never know that I still love you soThough the heartaches remainI'll do my crying in the rainRaindrops falling from heaven Will never wash away my miseryBut since we're not togetherI'll wait for stormy weatherTo hide these tears I hope you'll never seeSomeday when my crying's doneI'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sunI maybe a fool,but till then, darling youWill never see me complainI'll do my crying in the rainCrying in the rain
