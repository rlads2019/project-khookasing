As he steps out from the subwayAs he looks up into the skyThe sky looks blueAnd reminds him thatLove has made him a foolHe doesn't want to recall a pastWhich was so trueAn anonymous babeWho left him to surrender to fateHis tears are yet to dryFor The love he feels, he can't denyAnd every single nightHe finds comfort in his musicAllowing him to seek a moment of consolationHe repeated it in his mind that she saidShe'll understand himBut how long will it takeHe yearns for his love, his dearAnd since you askHow he views his loveWell, just like a MicroscopeAwaiting for her returnTo begin his grand finaleSo ...Do you really know who is Yida我一個人過了太久 我空虛了This is how I feel, the way I feel離開了家好久好久  我心累了This is how I feel, the way I feel寂寞是最好的朋友 也接受了This is how I feel, the way I feel我看著鏡子裡的我 孤單墮落This is how I feel, the way I feel我叼著煙躲在角落 我一句話都不想說This is how I feel我好想出去走一走 回味我從前的生活 This is how I feel我一個人努力的過 我沒放棄也沒退縮This is how I feel我的朋友都羡慕我 其實羨慕他們的人是我This is how I feel我沒有太多的自由 我已經失去了自由This is how I feel, the way I feel我唱著沒人要的歌 但我比誰都更快樂This is how I feel, the way I feel我愛的人 卻不愛我 卻征服我 卻離開我卻欺騙我 卻傷害我 卻背叛我我早就原諒你所犯的錯別再難過 就算愛錯  別再哭了 至少愛過再抽一口 就往前走This is how I feel, the way I feel~~我送妳到妳家門口 一轉眼就是十年後我含著淚心不說痛 又怎能忘記我們吻別的時候這些年寫著我的痛 每個音符都在訴說我一直在這裡守候 妳是否聽得見我唱的每一首請給我一秒鐘就夠 讓我唱完這一首我已沉默太久太久 而歲月它從不留我This is how I feel如果是一場夢 別把我喚醒讓我安靜睡 我不想錯過害怕醒過來 不見妳存在無奈的擁抱 殘酷的實在手上的玫瑰 刺在我手心痛轉移到心 淚就往下滴每一口呼吸 閉上眼聆聽就感覺到妳 深深愛著妳This is how I feel, the way I feel ~~
