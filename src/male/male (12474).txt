You can danceEvery dance with the guyWho gives you the eyeLet him hold you tightYou can smileEvery smile for the manWho held your hand'Neath the pale moonlightBut don't forget who's taking you homeAnd in who's arms you're gonna beSo darling, save the last dance for meOh I knowThat the music's fineLike sparkling wineGo and have your funLaugh and singBut while we're apartDon't give your heartTo anyoneAnd don't forget who's taking you homeAnd in who's arms you're gonna beSo darling, save the last dance for meBaby, don't you know I love you soCan't you feel it when we touchI will never, never let you goI love you, oh so much You can danceGo and carry onTill the night is goneAnd it's time to goIf he asksIf you're all aloneCan he walk you homeYou must tell him noCause don't forget who's taking you homeAnd in whose arms you're gonna beSave the last dance for meOh I knowThat the music's fineLike sparkling wineGo and have your funLaugh and singBut while we're apartDon't give your heartTo anyoneAnd don't forget who's taking you homeAnd in who's arms you're gonna beSo darling, save the last dance for meSo don't forget who's taking you homeOr in who's arms you're gonna beSo darling save the last dance for meOh baby, save the last dance for me*3
