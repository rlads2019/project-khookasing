Though we gotta say goodbye for the summerDarling, I promise you thisI'll send you all my loveEveryday in a letter sealed with a kissGuess it's gonna be a cool lonely summerBut I'll fill the emptinessI'll send you all my dreamsEveryday in a letter sealed with a kiss I'll see you in the sunlightI'll hear your voice everywhereI'll run to tenderly hold youBut darling you won't be thereI don't wanna say goodbye for the summerKnowing the love we'll missOh! Let us make a pledge to meet in SeptemberAnd sealed with a kiss
