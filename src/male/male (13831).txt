我等的模樣好不具象I forget what you look like as time goes by用皮膚感受你的流向To feel where you are你竟然能做到帶走陽光How can you taken away all my sunshine我一味的跟隨過了量I followed yet lost my way像風一樣Like the winds你靠近雲都下降You came with all clouds disappeared你捲起千層海浪You came with giant waves我躲也不躲往裡闖I break in with no hesitation你不就像風一樣Just like the winds侵略時沙沙作響You came with special sounds再宣佈恢復晴朗While sobering up就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣Pretended as we've never loved each other曲折的夕陽負責格擋Sunset covered my whispers讓委屈的感官無法釋放I can't release my sadness最近我的傷口沒生長My heart won't getting worse因為我躲在沒風的地方As I hid in a secret place像風一樣Like the winds 你靠近雲都下降You came with all clouds disappeared你捲起千層海浪You came with giant waves我躲也不躲往裡闖I break in with no hesitation你不就像風一樣Just like the winds侵略時沙沙作響You came with special sounds再宣佈恢復晴朗While sobering up again就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣Pretended as we've never loved each other你像風一樣You are the winds觸摸時溫柔流淌Gently flowing when you felt my touching席捲我所有抵抗不急著要我投降Dissolved all my resistance and even你不就像風一樣You are the winds掠奪時沙沙作響Came with special sounds可惜我自投羅網Cause I walked into the trap on my own你也就沒什麼可驕傲的地方There's nothing to be proud of和風一樣There's nothing to be proud of你離開不聲不響You left with no one noticed我喜歡這種收場I appreciate the way you leave看上去誰也不曾虧欠過對方As if there's nothing happened between us
