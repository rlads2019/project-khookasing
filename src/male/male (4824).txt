I wish Christmas could be good againThat you could forget everythingJust for one day I'd take you right backTo when you were a little girlTo when each day promised you pearlsBefore you grew up(Bridge)And I wish that we owned the house we live in And I wish that we had no bills to payAnd I wish I could find something this ChristmasSomething so valuable that it didn't cost(Chorus)Happy Christmas to youMay all your dreams come trueAnd may somebody save you tonightAnd may you still believe that I mightAnd may some things just turn out all right
