Alone in the city　Ain't no streets of goldWallowing in self pity　In a world so hard and coldWalking the streets in vain　To find a friendly faceBut all I got was pain　And was lost wthout a traceBridge　Scared and alone　I didn't have the strengthto carry on　I thought that I would never win this fightTook solace in my loneliness　But now I see the light(Chorus)　Coz-I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down againI said I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down againI 've danced with the devil　I have prayed to the Lord Drowned in a sea of sorrrowMy joie da vivre was searching for salvation from on highBut hope springs enternal like true loveAnd I made a vow somewhere, somehowThat I would rise above　(Chorus)　Coz-I-oh I-oh II'm never going down again　I said I-oh I-oh II'm never going down again　Looked to the sky I wassearching for salvation from on high　But hope springsenternal like true love　And I made a vow somewhere,somehow　That I would rise above　(Chorus)Coz-I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down again
