There are places I'll rememberAll my life though some have changedSome forever not for betterSome have gone and some remainAll these places had their momentsWith lovers and friends I still can recallSome are dead and some are livingIn my life I've loved them all But of all these friends and loversThere is no one compares with youAnd these memories lose their meaningWhen I think of love as something newThough I know I'll never lose affectionFor people and things that went beforeI know I'll often stop and think about themIn my life I'll love you moreIn my life I'll love you more
