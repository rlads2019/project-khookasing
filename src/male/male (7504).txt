If there will be you no morePain and sorrow will be allThat you can see in my eyesAnd I would rather dieOh! can you hear me cry?Can you feel I'm hurting inside my baby.Just when you said. when you said your goodbye.If there will beã€€no moreStars will have no one to aboreI'll live in ctaziness. Holding anyo loneliness Forever I'll be lost. Lost in a world without you. forever.cause you just said. Cause you said your goodbye.There'll be no more love affairCause no one understand romanceBaby I wnat one more danceOh! could you give me one more chanceIf I have done something wrongIf I have said something strong.Oh! I will make it right for you....I would never understand..oh!...Why you said goodbye...
