In the rain I'm standing hereI'm all alone and missing youI never want to let you go that wayIn the rain I'm all aloneRunning in the rain for youI wanna give my life to you to you I remember the days when we were happy and so gayI remember the days we lived in perfect harmonyFor so many times I let you down so many times I made you cryNever meant to be that way I only want to sayFor so many times I let you down so many times I made you cryNever meant to be that way I only want to sendSend my love to you
