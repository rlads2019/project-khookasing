When I See You Walking Down The StreetI Get So Shaky And I feel So WeakI Tell My Eyes Look The Other WayBut They Don't Listen To A Word I SayAnd I Go To Pieces And I Almost DieEvertime My Baby Passes ByI Tell My Arms To Hold Someone NewAnother Love That Will Be TrueBut They Don't ListenThey Don't Seem To CareThey Reach For her But She's not thereAnd I Go To Pieces And I Wanna HideGo To Pieces and I Almost DieEvertime My Baby Passes By I Remember What You SaidWhen You Said Goodbye BabyWe'll Meet Again Soon MaybeBut Until We Do All My Best To YouI'm So Lonely I Think About You OnlyI Go To Places We Used To GoBut I Know You'll Never ShowYou Hurt Me So Much InsideHow I Hope You're SatisfideAnd I Go To Pieces And I Wanna HideGo To Pieces And I Almost DieEvertime My Baby Passes ByGo To Pieces And I,(And Die)Go To Pieces And I,(Wanna Hide)Go To Pieces And I,My Baby
