Spend all your time waitingfor that second chancefor a break that would make it okaythere's always some reasonto feel not good enoughand it's hard at the end of the dayI need some distractionoh beautiful releasememorys seep through my veinslet me be emptyoh and weightless then maybeI'll find some peace tonightIn the arms of the angelfly away from herefrom this dark cold hotel roomand the endlessness that you fearyou are pulled from the wreckageof your silent reverieyou're in the arms of the angelmay you find some comfort here So tired of the straight lineand everywhere you turnthere's vultures and thieves at your backthe storm keeps on twistingkeep on building the liesthat you make up for all that you lackit don't make no differenceescape one last timeit's easier to believein this sweet madness ohthis glorious sadness that brings me to my kneesIn the arms of the angelfly away from herefrom this dark cold hotel roomand the endlessness that you fearyou are pulled from the wreckageof your silent reverieyou're in the arms of the angelmay you find some comfort hereyou're in the arms of the angelmay you find some comfort here
