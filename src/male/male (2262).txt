Try, try, tryBaby, don't you cryI will hold you tightThrough the nightYou'll be alrightTry, try, tryLet the pain pass (you) byThis isn't goodbyeLove never diesWe'll be alright So lucky to have called you mineOne last time to kiss your eyesBoth hearts uniteNo end in sightNo end in sightSo lucky to have called you mineRemember to be my guideClose your eyesUntil next timeI'll love you next life
