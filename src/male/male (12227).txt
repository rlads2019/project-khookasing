Don't leave me in all this painDon't leave me out in the rainCome back and bring back my smileCome and take these tears awayI need your arms to hold me nowThe nights are so unkindBring back those nights when I held you beside meUn-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you causedWhen you walked out the doorAnd walked out of my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many nightsUn-break my heartMy heartTake back that sad word good-byeBring back the joy to my lifeDon't leave me here with these tearsCome and kiss that pain awayI can't forget the day you leftTime is so unkindAnd life is so cruel without you here beside me Un-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you causedWhen you walked out the doorAnd walked out of my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many nightsUn-break my heartDon't leave me in all this painDon't leave me out in the rainBring back those nights when I held you beside meUn-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you causedWhen you walked out the doorAnd walked out of my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many nightsUndo this hurt you causedWhen you walked out the doorAnd wolded out of my lifeUn-break my heartUn-break my heartUn-break my heart
