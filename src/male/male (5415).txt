Am I Crazy?I can't believe I'm crying for the fallen leavesIt seems all memories have turned to dustWhere is my hands?I can't see any moreAm I crazy?I've closed my eyes and felt this pain a thousand timesWho spends his whole life to ease the pain?Who let you down?I'm crazy for I've got nothing any moreSometimes when I'm down I walk in the rainWith no one aroundSometimes when fear comes upon meI hide in dreamsWhere no one wakes me upAm I crazy?A hawk carries my soul to another worldand I shall never returnThere's something deep in my heartIt's sneaking out throngh my eyes
