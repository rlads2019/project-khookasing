You are the love of my lifeYou are the reason I'm aliveAnd baby baby babyWhen I think of how you saved meI go cracy, oh......And I've never known love like isIt fills me with a new tendernessYou're in my heart and you're in my soulYou're all I can't resistAnd I need to tell youThe first time I held youI knew, you are the love of my lifeAnd I spend a life time waitingAlways hesistating until you I was lost so deep inside my shellTill you came and saved me from myselfNow all I really know is I need youYou are the love of my lifeAnd all the joy and tears that I cryAnd baby baby babyYou don't have to say the wordI see it in your eyes'Cause we stand togetherI promise forever till the day that I dieYou are the love of my lifeYou are the love of my lifeYou are the reason I'm alive
