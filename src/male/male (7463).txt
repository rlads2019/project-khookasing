Am I still your lover　Am I still your manAm I still the one　You turn to when you're blueNot that it matters now　Still I wish it true＊Do you still remember　Promises we made　Ever after dreams we never thought would fade　But all is lost and what is left is a memory＃I'll whisper your name to the wind　I'll send a love note with the rain　She will tell you how much I'm missing you 　And praying that your heart will soon be Free to love again△Time will be your healer　Time will be your friend　Soon you'll say 「goodbye」 to heartache　But you'll always have a friendRepeat ＊,＃,＃Let the winter pass　Let the sun into your heartOpen up your door to life once moreRepeat △
