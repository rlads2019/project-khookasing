Well you woke me from a dream about youJust to say that you were leavin'I'm sleepy but I though that you said our loveThat would last forever is endin'Well before you walk out of my lifeWould you be specially quietDon't you let my heart know that you're leavin'Don't you say another word about it darlin'Don't you let my heart your footstepsWalkin' out the door of my hopes and dreams And don't you let my heart know that you're leavin'Don't you say another word about it darlin'Leave me now, before my heart finds itWell, I see you writing somethin' downAnd leavin' it on the dresserThe tears in your eyes look a lot like mineBut I guess it's all for the betterWell, before we say our last goodbyeBaby, won't you hold me just one more time
