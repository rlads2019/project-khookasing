Believing in youbelieving in mebelieving in love{Songs of birds)} Songs of birds fill the airThe autumn hues everywhereThere's a sense of love and peaceI feel where I am being with you as we are All the trouble in the world won't scare meif I'm right there with you through it allBelieving in youbelieving in mebelieving in loveNow I know I really feel in my heartmore than all the sun e'r released in all it's hoursBelieving in youbelieving in mebelieving in love
