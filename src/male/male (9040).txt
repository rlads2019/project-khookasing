Turn down the lightsTurn down the bedTurn down these voicesInside my headLay down with meTell me no liesJust hold me closeDon't patronizeDon't patronize meI can't make you love me if you don'tYou can't make your heart feelSomethin' that it wontHere in the dark in these final hoursI will lay down my heartAnd I will feel the power but you won'tNo you won'tCause I can't make you love meWhen you don'tI'll close my eyes 'Cause then I won't seeThe love you don't feelWhen you're holdin' meMorning will comeAnd I do what's rightJust give me till thenTo give up this fightAnd I will give up this fight'Cause I can't make you love meif you don'tYou can't make your heart feelSomethin' that it wontHere in the dark in these final hoursI will lay down my heartI will feel the power but you won'tNo you won't'Cause I can't make you love me
