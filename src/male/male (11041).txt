Open your misty eyes, Here comes another fightThere's a stormy night, before the morning arrivesNo matter where you go, I will follow youKeep careful watch of your soulSmashing through the door, into another worldPicking up my sword, nothing I can't conquerI'll keep carrying on, We have to be strongStill a long long way to run, until I see the sunI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's solve the mystery and live a dreamI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's write our story, Let's make our fantasy come true Smashing through the door, into another worldPicking up my sword, nothing I can't conquerI'll keep carrying on, We have to be strongStill a long long way to run, until I see the sunI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's solve the mystery and live a dreamI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's write our story, Let's make our fantasy come trueI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's solve the mystery and live a dreamI see the lights, I hear the triumphLet's write our story, Let's make our fantasy come truecome true
