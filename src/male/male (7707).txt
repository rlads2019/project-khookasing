Crash There's a beating in my chest when I remember usYea yea yea yeaLove And my head is like a photo album saving upYea yea yea yeaI miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the way of the old daysSeeHow the world it keeps on changing try to slow it downYea yea yea yeaFeels Like I'm overwhelmed but now I'm missing you around I miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the wayI miss the way of the old daysCus we can't be there anymoreHate to see our memories fadeWish that I could just hold itAnd even though it's in my mindall I have are pictures of daysCan't relive all the momentsThe momentsI miss the way of the old days[ar: 周興哲][ti:Old Days][al: 終於了解自由][length: 03:16]
