Oh come onSmile a little smile for meRose marry where the use in cryingLittle little while you seeRose marry you must keep on tryingI know that he hurt you bedI know darling don't be sad and Smile a little smile for meRose marry, rose marryI guess your lonely nowLove is coming to an endBut darling only nowAre you free to start againLift up your pretty chinDon't let those tears beginYou're a big girl nowAnd you'll pull thro some howSmile a little smile for meRose marry, rose marry
