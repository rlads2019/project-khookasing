Sick at heart and lonelyDeep in dark despair.When you want her onlyTell me where is she where?And if she says to youThat she don't love me.Just give her my messageTell her of my plea.And I know, if I could have her back again, I would never make her sad.I got a heart full of soul.I got a heart full of soul.She's been gone such a long time,Longer than I can bear.But if she says she wants me,Tell her I'll be there.I got a heart full of soul.I got a heart full of soul.I got a heart full of soul!
