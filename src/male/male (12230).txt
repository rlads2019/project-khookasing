I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smileI spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wildAnd there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonightI ain't missing you at all since you've been gone awayI ain't missing you, no matter what I might sayThere's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonightYou don't know how desperate I've becomeAnd it looks like I'm losing this fightIn your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understandAnd it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonightChorus:I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends sayAnd there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soulAnd if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload(chorus)I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, I can lie to myselfAnd there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight(chorus)Ain't missing you, I ain't missing youI ain't missing you, I can lie to myselfAin't missing you, I ain't missing youI ain't missing you, I ain't missing youI ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, ain't missing you, oh no
