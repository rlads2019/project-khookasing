When I said I needed youYou said you would always stayIt wasn't me who changed but youAnd now you've gone awayDon't you know that now you've goneAnd I'm left here on my ownThat I have to follow youAnd beg you, beg you to come homeYou don't have to say you love meJust be close at hand You don't have to stay foreverI will understandBelieve me, believe meI can't help but love youBut believe me I'll never tie you downLeft alone with the memoryLife seems dead and so unrealAll that's left is lonelinessThere's nothing left to feelBelieve me, believe me, believe me
