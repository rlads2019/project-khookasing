Someday he'll come along, The man I loveAnd he'll be big and strong, The man I loveAnd when he comes my wayI'll do my best to make him stayHe'll look at me and smile, I'll understandThen in a little while, He'll take my handAnd though it seems absurdI know we both won't say a wordMaybe I shall meet him Sunday,Maybe Monday, maybe notStill I'm sure to meet him one dayMaybe Tuesday will be my good news day He'll build a little home, That's meant for twoFrom which I'll never roam, Who would, would youAnd so all else aboveI'm dreaming of the man I loveVocal: Karen MokPiano: Bugge WesseltoftGuitars: Lawrence KuBass: Eun-Chang ChoiPercussion: Arai SoichiroDrums: Yong Heng Wu
