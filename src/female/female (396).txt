No more runningWe are on the edge of what could be the endDon't come any closer to meI guarantee you that's not what you wantI'm sure you thought that I would just lay downBut you were wrongGive me all you got, don't hold nothin' backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shot, I'll just give it backI'm on the winning side, we won't be defeatedI'm not afraid to die cause life is a battleAnd fighting me, it'll be like fighting shadowsNo surrenderI know how this ends, have been thereAnd it doesn't look good for youDon't come any closer to meI guarantee you that's not what you wantI'm sure you thought that I would just lay downBut you were wrong Give me all you got, don't hold nothin' backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shot, I'll just give it backI'm on the winning side, we won't be defeatedI'm not afraid to die cause life is a battleAnd fighting me, it'll be like fighting shadowsIt's all about survival, I'm doin' whatever's liableTo spend a day and a night with me, prolly could write a novelI'm goin' through Hell and back so every room got a BibleMy enemies and my rivals is prolly within a mileI'm readyThey want me to lay down or stay down but that ain't my fate nowI'm a hundred percent if you're testin' my faithThat I'm from a city where war is a playgroundI've been livin' right and wrong, honestly it's just so much to sayBut only God can judge me, if I die today it's judgement day, straight upGive me all you got, don't hold nothin' backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shot, I'll just give it backI'm on the winning side, we won't be defeatedI'm not afraid to die cause life is a battleAnd fighting me, it'll be like fighting shadows
