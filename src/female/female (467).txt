You come from far awayWith pictures in your eyesOf coffee shops and morning streetsIn the blue and silent sunriseBut night is the cathedralWhere we recognized the signWe strangers know each other nowAs part of the whole designOh, hold me like a babyThat will not fall asleepCurl me up inside youAnd let me hear you through the heatYou are the jester of this courtyardWith a smile like a girl'sDistracted by the womenWith the dimples and the curlsBy the pretty and the mischievousBy the timid and the blessedBy the blowing skirts of ladiesWho promise to gather you too their breast (Chorus)You have hands of raining waterAnd that earring in your earThe wisdom on your faceDenies the number of your yearsWith the fingers of the potterAnd the laughing tale of the foolThe arranger of disorderWith your strange and simple rulesYes now I've met me another spinnerOf strange and gauzy threadsWith a long and slender bodyAnd a bump upon the head(Chorus)With a long and slender bodyAnd the sweetest softest handsAnd we'll blow away forever soonAnd go on to different landsAnd please do not ever look for meBut with me you will stayAnd you will hear yourself in songBlowing by one day
