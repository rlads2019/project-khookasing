It's cold outsideAnd a silver cloud hangs low over the morning skylineThere is no sound other than my heartbeatAnd snowflakes dance like firefliesIn the distance a billboard shines through the mistAnd on it I can read my nameAnd a shortMessage:'To live outside of time is to be free''Have a nice day'Traffic is heavyAnd rain has fallen on the cityTo one side of me , I hear a voiceIt is a man without a faceAnd he has a bookWritten in a language I cannot understandSeventeen peopleenter the white building at the same timeAnd the clock has stopped at nineOn the elevator wall is written:'Only love can set you free''This is your lucky day'AND SO I SAY TO MYSELFMAYBE THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FORMAYBE THIS IS THE MOMENT MAYBE THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FREETime itself is frozenSomewhere a telephone is ringingIs that for me ? Can that be for me ?There IS a voice thereAnd it's one I've heard beforeCould have been a dream - or at leastAnother place,another timePerhaps we can rendezvous ?Put a name to a faceOr a face to a name ?But already I know what it is he has to say:'Only by leaving can you truly arrive'HAVE A NICE DAY!AND SO I SAY TO MYSELFMAYBE THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FORMAYBE THIS IS THE MOMENTMAYBE THIS WILL BE MY LUCKY DAYIt's cold outsideAnd a silver cloud hangs low over the morning skylineThere is no sound other than my heartbeatAnd snowflakes dance like fireflies
