我以為　永遠可以這樣相對　好幾回　這樣地想起捨不得睡如果你能給我一個真誠的絕對　無所謂　我甚麼都無所謂前面的路　也許真的並不太清楚　放心地走了以後也許會覺得辛苦　也許會想停也停不住天越黑　心越累　我看見　你的臉　聽著你說不出口的誓言那一刻　我發現　我有天　經過你的身邊　找不到你的視線把我的　心交給你來安慰　能不能　從此就不用再收回別以為執著的心就不會被碰碎　別以為　我真的無所謂---------------------------------------------------------Faye Wong - Pledge English translation from wongfaye.orgI thought that we could be together foreverLots of times, I think of this and I don't want to fall asleepIf you could give me a sincere certaintyIt doesn't matter; nothing matters to meThe road ahead is perhaps not too clearAfter I proceed on confidently, perhaps I'll find it exhaustingPerhaps I'll want to stop but can't stopThe darker the sky becomes, the more tired my heart becomesI saw your face, listened to your unvoiced pledgeAt that moment I discoveredThat one day I walked past you and didn't catch your gazeI take my heart and give it to you to consoleIs it possible for me not to have to take it back?[Please]don't think that an assiduous heart is unbreakable[Please]don't think that nothing matters to me
