You are my sunshine, my only sunshineYou make me happy when skies are grayYou'll never know dear, how much I love youPlease don't take my sunshine awayThe other night, dear, as I lay sleepingI dreamed I held you in my arms When I awoken, dear, I was mistakenSo I hung my head and criedYou are my sunshine, my only sunshineYou make me happy when skies are grayYou'll never know dear, how much I love youPlease don't take my sunshine awaySo Please don't take my sunshine away
