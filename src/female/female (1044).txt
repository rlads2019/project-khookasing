Everytime when I fell asleep,I wish I won't pretend to sleep,Oh no Maybe I am a freak.Everytime when I shed a tear,How I wish I won't take responsibility,To make you sorry.But the lazy days lie on my bed,The story goes on, Years go by,The shadow tells me,Sentimental kills.Everytime when I fell asleep,I wish I really have a beautiful dream,To make me happy.save save save save save save.
