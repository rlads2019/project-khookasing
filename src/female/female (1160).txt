My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at allThe morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at allAnd even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wallIt reminds me that it's not so badIt's not so badI drank too much last night, got bills to payMy head just feels in painI missed the bus and there'll be hell todayI'm late for work againAnd even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the dayAnd then you call me and it's not so badIt's not so bad and I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my lifeOh~ just to be with you is having the best day of my lifePush the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and throughThen you handed me a towel and all I see is youAnd even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clueBecause you're near me andI want to thank you for giving me the best day of my lifeOh~ just to be with you is having the best day of my lifeAnd I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my lifeOh~ just to be with you is having the best day of my life[中譯]我的茶冷了，我正在奇怪，為何我要奇床？晨雨模糊了我的窗子，我為什麼都看不見，即使我能看清楚，窗外也是灰暗一片，但是牆上你的照片，卻提醒我事情沒有那麼糟糕，沒有那麼糟糕。我昨夜喝了太多，還有帳單等著付，我的頭隱隱作痛，我錯過了公車，今天鐵定很慘！我上班又要遲到了，就算我趕得及準時上班，大家也會暗示，我很可能撐不了一整天，接著，你打電話給我，告訴我事情沒納麼糟糕，事情沒有那麼糟糕。而我想要謝謝你，謝謝你給我生命最棒的一天，喔，只要與你一起，就是擁有生命裡最美好的一天。推開門，我終於回到家而且全身溼透，然後你遞給我一條毛巾，我眼裡見的全是你，即使我的房子突然倒下來，我也渾然不覺，因為你就在我身邊。
