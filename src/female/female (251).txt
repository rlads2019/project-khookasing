Ooh......Hey there, what is it todayThink I'm gonna forget againThat I couldn't be the oneWish I had a name and a friendI'm in pain can't you see it you feel itNow there's nobody there ooh I tell youI'm in shame, I'm not worthy I'm bleedingThe flower don't even careThis cipher from nowhere Ooh......I'm not the one to hold your handIt must have been a bad day againFor you, who couldn't stand my face?You wish I could be out of your sightI can't help it I'm ugly I know itNow I'm nobody's friend, ooh I tell youI'm in shame; I'm not worthy of beingMy father don't even care
