There'll be days when everything don't go your wayGot no one to blameIt's just the moon and stars that have gone out of lineIt's gonna be okayIt's as if the world always walk out on youWhen you needed faithSuch a cross to bear not to cry about itBut you'll be okayChorus: Cos it's only a game with fateYou lose some you'll gainIt's all about how you playSo play it cool with graceThen maybe one dayYou'll end up winning this gameYou can keep on givingBut in the end getNothing in returnBut don't overanalyze they're just lessons to learnKeep telling yourself
