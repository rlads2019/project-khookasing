I started looking at the sky today'Cause it's so deep and so far awayI've got too many things inside my headI wish that I could be up there instead(chorus)No one was meant to beLiving here in this concrete seaEveryone including meWishes that we could be set freeThen I looked into the ocean blue'Cause It's so deep and it's so quiet tooThere's just too many people everwhereI wish that I was down there (chorus)No one was meant to beLiving here in this concrete seaEveryone including meWishes that we could be set freeI heard a story being told todayAbout a man and how he got awayYou got to leave the things you grow up forSo duck your head and swim for shore(chorus)No one was meant to beLiving here in this concrete seaEveryone including meWishes that we could be set free
