Jingle bell Jingle bell Jingle bell rockJingle bell swing and Jingle bell ringSnowing and blowing a bushel of funNow the jingle hop has begunJingle bell Jingle bell Jingle bell rockJingle bell chime and Jingle bell timeDancing and prancing Jingle bell squareIn the frosty air What a bright time It's the right timeTo rock the night awayJingle bell time It's a swell timeTo go gliding in a one horse sleighGiddy up Jingle horse Pick up your feetJingle around the clockMix and mingle in jingle beatThat's the jingle bell rock
