now that she's back in the atmosphereWith drops of jupiter in her hair, hey, heyShe acts like summer and walks like rainReminds me that there's time to change, hey, heySince the return from her stay on the moonShe listens like spring and she talks like june, hey, heyTell me did you sail across the sunDid you make it to the milky way to see the lights all fadedAnd that heaven is overratedTell me, did you fall for a shooting starOne without a permanent scarAnd did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out thereNow that she's back from that soul vacationTracing her way through the constellation, hey, heyShe checks out mozart while she does tae-boReminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey Now that she's back in the atmosphereI'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' janeTold a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did landTell me did the wind sweep you off your feetDid you finally get the chance to dance along the light of dayAnd head back to the milky wayAnd tell me, did venus blow your mindWas it everything you wanted to findAnd did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out thereCan you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chickenYour best friend always sticking up for you even when i know you're wrongCan you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phoneConversationThe best soy latte that you ever had . . . and meTell me did the wind sweep you off your feetDid you finally get the chance to dance along the light of dayAnd head back toward the milky wayRepeat 1st chorus
