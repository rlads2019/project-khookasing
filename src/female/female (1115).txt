Don't know whyThere's no sun up in the sky,Stormy weatherSince my man and I ain't togetherKeeps raining all the timeLife is bareGloom and misery everywhereStormy weatherJust can't get my poor self togetherI'm weary all the time, the time,so weary all the time When he went away, the blues walked in and met meIf he stays away, old rocking chair will get meAll I do is pray that the Lord abovewill let me walk in the sun once moreCan't go onEverything I had is goneStormy weatherSince my man and I ain't togetherKeeps raining all the time
