Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it thereSunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hairPicked up a pencil and wrote 'I love you' in my finest handWanted to send it, but I don't know where I standTelephone, even the sound of your voice is still newAll alone in California and talking to you And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had plannedI guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I standCrickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled greenThickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dreamAll muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I canI know that I miss you, but I don't know where I standI know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
