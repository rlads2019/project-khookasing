Am I somebody changed?Cause without no makeup on I feel shameNo you can't smoke or swearNow my life will never be the sameCould these be the wicked signsOf tryin be a superstarCould these be the wicked signsWould you like an autograph of mine? Everyday starving myselfCos I gotta be a prefect size 8Try beat a pimple raceNow my life will never be the sameI thought I heard my nameAs I walked along the streets I felt strangeSomebody's watchin my faceAnd now my life will never be the same?Ba da da......My life will never be the sameBa da da......My life will never be the same
