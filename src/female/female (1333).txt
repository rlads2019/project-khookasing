Life is a moment to space , when dream is gone ,it's a lonelier place .I kiss the morning goodbye , but down inside ,you know we never know why .The road is narrow and long , when eyes meet eyes ,and the feeling is strong .I turn away from the wall I strumble like fall ,but I give you it all .I am a woman in love , and I'll do anything ,to get you into my world , and hold you within .It's alright I defend , over and over again , What do I do . With your eternity mind , and love there is no measure of time .We plan it all at the startDid you and I live in each other's hearts .We may be oceans away , you feel my love ,I hear what you've said .The truth is ever and I , I strumble like fall ,and I give you it all .I'm a woman in love , and I'm talking to you ,I know how you feel ,what a woman can do , It's alright I defend over and over again
