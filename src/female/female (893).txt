See the tear in your eyesLet it fall from the skyMeet the rainbow as it comes behindThere's a vision for youThat you're not letting throughTime for letting go that state of mindIt's better to love and to lose, so they sayThan never have loved at allSo don't hang around feeling sad, looking downIt's a lesson, you might as well learnC'est la vie You give and you get, you live and you letNo-one said it was easyEt d'amourYou never look back, never ever regretLetting go it's not easyWhat is up without downOr the lost without foundWhat is love without a little painSometimes the one thing you fearKeeps on holding you thereTime for giving up the crying gameLove is amazing when you figure it out
