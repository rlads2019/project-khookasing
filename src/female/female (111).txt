I'm frightened by the thought of hanging around too much on my ownThat's when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughtsSomething's wrong with me yet I can't figure it out by myselfWhen will it be all right?Time passes by so slowly when you cannot sleep at nightWhen someone right comes along you let him slip awayThe streets are filled with sirens chasing down the violenceDamn ! When will it be all right?No it doesn't get betterWhen people fake it saying they understandWhat to them doesn't matterHow I ever got to feeling so lowI can't recall much happy moments in my childhood years When someone laughs at me I'm nowhere to run and hideConstantly seeking ways to make a point but no one hearsWhen will I be all right?Don't you start making compromisesIt wouldn't be of any use to me nowDon't you start maling up for timeBecause it wouldn't be all rightI'm frightened but the thought of hanging around too much on my ownThat's when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughtsSomething's wrong with me yet I ca'mt figure it out all by myselfWhen will it be all right?Damn! When will it be all right?Damn! When will it be all right?
