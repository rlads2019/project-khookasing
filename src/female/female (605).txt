We never have a kiss in a crowdor walk along the street holding handsWe haven't gone out just the two of usDon't even have a photo togetherEvery time that I think about youThere is something shining in the airIt's just too bad that nobody can seeOnly I know that it is realInvisible love love loveIt doesn't really matterIf only you can feel itInvisible love love loveIf only I can find myself in your eyes I always go to the movies aloneIt seems I never give you a callThere is not a trace of you, my babyAnywhere in my roomEvery time that I think about youThere is something shining in the airIt's just too bad that nobody can seeOnly I know that it is realInvisible love love loveIt doesn't really matterIf only you can feel itInvisible love love loveIf only I can find myself in your eyesEvery time that I think about you
