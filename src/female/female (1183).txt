Some say love it is a river that drowns the tender reed有人說 愛是條河 容易將脆弱的蘆草淹沒Some say love it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed有人說 愛是把刀 會任由你的靈魂淌血Some say love it is a hunger, an endless aching need有人說 愛是種饑渴 一種永無止境帶痛的需求I say love it is a flower我說 愛是一朵花And you it's only seed而你 只是花的種籽It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance害怕破碎的心 舞不起來It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance害怕醒來的夢 不敢冒險It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give 不願吃虧的人 不懂得付出And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live憂心死亡的靈魂 不會生活When the night has been too lonely當夜顯得寂寞不堪And the road has been too long去路顯得無盡漫長And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong當你覺得只有幸運者及強者才有幸得到愛Just remember in the winter謹記 在嚴寒的冬日裡Far beneath the bitter snow酷雪的覆蓋下Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose躺著一粒種籽 一旦春陽臨照 就能幻化成一朵 玫瑰
