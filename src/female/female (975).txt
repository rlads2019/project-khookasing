One morning I woke upI felt as if I suddenlyjust couldn't seeLittle girl inside of me.So I pretend to smile againit's not that easyeverytime I see myself I just can't breatheOn a rainy day you walked along my sideand brushed the raindrops from my eyes and thenyou asked me if I'd be alrightNever thought I'd ever feel the sunlight shining through my wintery skyHold me tight baby hold me tight, won't you dim the lights.La La La La La La La La La La LaLa La La La La La La La LaI want to sing my love songs to youLet me hold youLa La La La La La La La LaI can't stop thinking about youPlease baby please tell me that you love me I don't wanna cry no more but am I brave enough?To Face the pain and fear he left behind for meI've been deeply hurt before with all the wounds he gave meIt's killing meonly if you seeLoving you the sound of burning cigarettesFalling ashes on my lonely bedI told you I can't live without youLet me love youI won't regretFor all the times we've been throughPlease baby please tell me that you love meLa La La La La La La La La La LaLa La La La La La La La LaI want to sing my love songs to youOn my lonely nightLa La La La La La La La La LaI can't stop thinking about youPlease baby please tell me that you love meNever thought that it would hurt me so deep[ti:Please][ar:Janice Vidal][al:Morning]
