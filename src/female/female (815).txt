MidnightNot a sound from the pavementHas the moon lost her memoryShe is smiling aloneIn the lamplightThe withered leaves collect at my feetAnd the wind begins to moanMemory, all alone in the moonlightI can dream of the old daysLife was beautiful thenI remember the time I knew what happiness wasLet the memory live againEvery street lamp seems to beatA fatalistic warningSomeone mutters and the street lamp sputtersSoon it will be morningDaylightI must wait for the sunrise I must think of a new life andI mustn't give inWhen the dawn comesTonight will be a memory tooAnd a new day will beginBurnt out ends of smoky daysThe stale court smell of morningA street lamp diesAnother night is overAnother day is dawningTouch me,It is so easy to leave meAll alone with the memoryOf my days in the sunIf you'll touch me,You'll understand what happiness isLook, a new day has begun...
