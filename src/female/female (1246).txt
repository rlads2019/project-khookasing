Vino de amor from the magical vine.Once you've taken a sip of that sweet summer wine,you'll be lost in its spell.Then I know you'll be mine.So let's drink to el vino de amor.Vino de amor and the taste of your lips leave a heavenly glow when I have stolen a kiss.It's a moment in time like a total eclipse.So let's drink to el vino de amor. As evening falls you are here in my arms.And the sound of the sea is like a million guitars.We'll　lie beneath the blanket of stars.And we'll drink el vino de amor.We've tasted love on a warm starry night.As I look in your eyes in the soft morning light.Now I'll never forget such a beautiful sight.Here's a toast to el vino de amor.
