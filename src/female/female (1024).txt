So come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for youCome on and seeCome on aroundCome on over and be with meCome into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for youWon't you come on and seeCome on aroundCome on overI'll be there out on the streetsTo get you autumn leavesFresh dew from spring And the summers heatThe crystal clear icicles of winters timeSo you can put your tears awayAnd all of your regretsI assure youOur love is everything to gainAnd nothing else to loseSo come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for youCome on and seeCome on aroundCome on over and be with meCome into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for youWon't you come on and seeCome on aroundCome on overI know you haven't made upHaven't made up your mindBut sooner on laterI know I know you'llCome come into The Sanctuary of Love for you
