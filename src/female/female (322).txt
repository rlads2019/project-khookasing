I saw a picture of a small girlCrying and living in a lost worldThe men fight for dear God　She don't careCause there ain't nothing left to shareI'd watched T.V. about a sick girlShe was only nine but she'll be gone soonWhen and where she's going God will knowShe doesn't want the sun to goDon't you know that we careKeep the faith and hope is hereDeep in my heart I ask myself Do we really really careI read the paper of a colored boyHe was starving so we're the lone vulturesWhy so full of sorrow no tomorrowThere's no rainbow　Will he ever know?Don't you know that we careKeep the faith and hope is hereDeep in my heart I ask myselfDo we really really careDon't you know that we prayFor you to see the light of dayFor you to bring back the look of loveWords of wisdom　Is it enough
