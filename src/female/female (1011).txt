Remember,Running aroundThe merry-go-roundBehind that sycamore tree with meRemember,Laughing aboutAnd singing and shoutingAll my blues away'badaa dada do daydadada do day'You made me feel so specialJust like the stars up in the skyWe'll shine forever in the nightEvery nightAs time goes byTime goes byBottlesBottles of wined lager and limePiled on Old Dr. SeussSo radYou're so bad Fumbling around, blood on the groundTears came tumbling downbada dada do dayYou kissed my pain awayYou made me feel so specialJust like the stars up in the skyWe'll shine forever in the nightEvery nightAs time goes byTime goes bySo longto lazy days and burning heartsWe're lying underneath the starsWhile Billy sings 'I love you just the way you are'I'll never love like this againRunning aroundAll over townJust like Mickey and MaloryRememberRing from a can, you put on my hand,And made me call you my manBadaa dada do dayRemember me that way
