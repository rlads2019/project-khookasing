Don't call him up anymoreCause I don't wanna hear your voiceI don't wanna see your face answer his doorMake no mistake , he's mine , he's mine 　 He's mineHe only knows how I feel 　 I only know what he's likeWhen he needs me , oh , how he needs meDeep in the night 　 Make no mistake ,he's mine , he's mine 　 He's mineDon't get too close when you dance 'Cause I don't wanna hear from my friendsYou were out on the townThere in his arms , there in his armsDon't include him in your dreams 　 ( I wanna be in his dreams )Cause I don't wanna close my eyes 　 ( my eyes )I don't wanna know where he goesEach night when he leavesMake no mistake , he's mine , he's mine 　 He's mineDon't call him up anymoreDon't call him up anymore
