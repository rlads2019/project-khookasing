I'm facing the world with an empty heartI could disappear into the darkAnd you were the one who could make my dreamsCome true (My dear, it's you)When you're not around, my heart stood stillWithin you'll remain and always will我愛你, I love you我愛你, I need youMore than I ever did anyoneI've never felt like this before我愛你, I want you 我愛你, I need youWe could be two lovers from the pastAnd the future is our chanceWhen you're not around, my heart stood still (My dear, it's you)Within you'll remain and always will我愛你, I love you我愛你, I need youMore than I ever did anyoneI've never felt like this before我愛你, I want you我愛你, I need youWe could be two lovers from the pastAnd the future is our chance
