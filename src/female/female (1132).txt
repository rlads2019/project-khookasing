Baby maybe this is it. Just look at the sight.Well it's fogging my eyes.How can I cry when I've caught a lieTry to understand. Let me make a standOh baby not again. You say baby not againIt's so like you Making me sad. Your tears in my eyes.I'm shrinking to a lie. But look, I see light.Baby maybe I am blind. I have lost my sight. I have covered my eyes. On how to decide.When I am too kind. Your guess is as good as mine.Your guess is as good as mine. Oh baby not again.Please don't point at me againYes it was you. Making me bad. Your tears in my eyes.I'm shrinking to your kind. All of it, all this is wrong.What I've withnessed is a nightmare all alongï¼´his ride's a quest to save one from one.Perhaps one day,perhaps one day,one day I'll realign.
