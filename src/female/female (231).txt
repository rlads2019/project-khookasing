C'est La VieHave your leaves all turned to brownWill you scatter them around youC'est La VieDo you loveAnd then how am I to knowIf you don't let your love show for meC'est La Vie*C'est La Vie, C'est La VieWho knows, who cares for meC'est La Vie*In the nightDo you light a lover's fire Do the ashes of desire for you remainLike the seaThere's a live too deep to showTook a storm before my live flowed for youC'est La VieLike a songOut of tune and out of timeAll I needed was a rhymw for youC'est La VieDo you giveDo you live from day to dayIs there no song I can play for youC'est La Vie
