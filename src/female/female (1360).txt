And you can turn and walk away so easilyBut you can't say , you don't love me anymoreYou can dream of what might have beenYou can cry for what won't pass againAnd you can say there's every reason you should leaveBut you can't say, you don't love me anymoreYou can say 'I'm right you're wrong'You can make your plans to find somebody elseBut I can't believe you can carry on We know what should be saidBut you can't find the wordsInstead you say--all thing must endYou can smile and even pretendAnd you can turn and say you're leaveing me for goodBut you can't say, you don't love me anymoreAnd you can turn and say you're leaveing me for goodBut you can't say , you don't love meFirst just say, you don't love me anymore
