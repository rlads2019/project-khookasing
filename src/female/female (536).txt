I started a jokeWhich started the whole world cryingBut I didn't seeThat the joke was on me, oh noI started to cryWhich started the whole world laughingOh, if I'd only seenThat the joke was on meI looked at the skiesRunning my hands over my eyesAnd I fell out of bedHurting my head from things that I'd said 'Til I finally diedWhich started the whole world livingOh, if I'd only seenThat the joke was on meI looked at the skiesRunning my hands over my eyesAnd I fell out of bedHurting my head from things that I'd said'Til I finally diedWhich started the whole world livingOh, if I'd only seenThat the joke was on me,oh noThat the joke was on me
