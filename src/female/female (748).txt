I don't need some guy to wine and dine me all the time.I don't need some other guy to tell me I look fine.I won't hear a lie even if it's all you have to say.No more empty promises to keep me hanging on a line.Just as the music plays on and on each and every day.* Hey Hey There is no other way.Simply smile a little smile for you. No matter what you do.Love youself every way.Feeling good that's your natural right.Love yourself every day.Looking good all thru' day and night.You oughtta know by now baby. Feeling love is all need to be a lady.*All I need's a lover who'll stand by me thru' and thru'.and I need a love that's goona stay forever true.
