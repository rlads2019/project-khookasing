Do you know, no one can ever make me crazyBut do you know, I've been frenzy alreadyI pray for love of you and meUndoubtedly, I'll stay by thee eternally*Here you are, it's whole of my heartI gave you from the startTo shine you in the darkNever too far, I'm living in your heart We are meant to be together foreverThere is nothing could separate us*I know you will cherish me earnestlyI know I'll be always your one and onlyI don't need to be a Sleeping BeautyUndoubtedly, there's no any Broken fantasyDo you know, I'm adoring you affectionatelyAnd do you know, i take this fancy sincerelyWithout you I'll be drowsyUndoubtedly, you're the only perfect one for me
