Come on, I never played with youTry to play me for air foolI never played with you But baby it's cool我才不習慣吃醋　我也不喜歡吃苦　少了你來愛我等於多了一條出路我對全世界宣佈　你們將會好忙碌　因為我終於能和其他人一起跳舞我和你打招呼　因為最好報復　就是肯饒恕　不管你對我　多離譜我就是不投訴　我就是好風度　你不妨來欣賞我復原的速度變　變　變魔術　來看我演出　把失戀這個包袱　變成一份禮物過去若不結束　怎麼能進步　就讓更多人追逐　那麼酷不由你不佩服(你千萬別忌妒) When we started baby girl nothing messy it was all goodGave you everything you wanted everything that I couldCan't replace love you with money and you knew itYou had a damn good thing and girl you blew itI played around on you cause I'm sure you did the samemachi shiao Pang Dsi I'm a master at this gameGood-bye for the last time our love is all wrongHere's some magic for ya baby girl poof be gone只有快樂的任務　沒有難過的義務　你迷人的程度不值得我被你欺負誰也看見我付出　只有你難得糊塗　你敢不敢打賭我願意對你們祝福If you're single and you know it, throw your hands up
