I hear your voice in every corridorI see your face in every picture frameI feel your eyes in every starry skyLover, am I coming home again?Now am I humble, who once was proudNow am I silent, who once was loudNow am I waiting for the sound of your sayingLover, am I coming home again?When you're gone the sun don't shineLight a light, light a light for meBring me back home again And how we loved 'til the years were daysHow we laughed all our tears awayAnd now the time begins to fadeLover, am I coming home again?There's a wisdom in the teachings of the old familiar songsAnd a sorrow in repeating all the old familiar wrongsAnd a lesson to be learned though I've known all day longLover, am I coming home again?Light a light, light a light for meLight a light, light a light for meLight a light, light a light for meBring me back home againBring me back home again
