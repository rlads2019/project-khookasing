It must have been cold there in my shadowTo never have sunlight on your faceYou were content to let me shine. That's your wayYou always walked a step behindSo I was the one with all the gloryWhile you were the one with all the strengthA beautiful face without a name for so longA beautiful smile to hide the painDid you ever know that you're my heroAnd everything I would like to beI could fly higher than an eagleFor you're the wind beneath my wingsIt might have appeared to go unnoticedBut I got it all here in my heartI want you to know I know the truthOf course I know itI would be nothing without you Did you ever know that you're my heroYour everything I wish I could beI can fly higher than an eagleFor you're the wind beneath my wingsDid I ever tell you my heroYour everything everything I wish I could beAnd I, I can fly higher than an eagleFor you're the wind beneath my wingsYou're the wind beneath my wingsYou're the wind beneath my wingsoh, the wind beneath my wingsyou...you are the wind beneath my wingsfly...fly away, you let me fly so highoh, you...you are the wind beneath my wingsoh, you...the wind beneath my wingsfly...fly against the skyso high i almost touch the skythank you, thank youthank god for you -- the wind beneath my wings
