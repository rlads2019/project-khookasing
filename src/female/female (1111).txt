Somewhere in the middle of the nightIn between a dream, I swear I saw youI shook awake, I tried to shake your shadowThe more I tried, the more I lost controlIs it my imaginationOr have you been calling for me?Why do you keep hiding in my dreams?Boy you better let it out and show meAnd hit or miss - Steal a KissTake a chance, let it all goThere is no risk if you just Steal a KissEveryday you catch my eyeBut you never move on over...And everynight your image comes aroundBoy you better let it out and show me And hit or miss - Steal a KissTake a chance, let it all goThere is no risk if you just Steal a KissI can see behind your eyesThe silhouette of love and longingCan't you see the same thing in mine?Boy you better let it out and show meAnd hit or miss - Steal a KissTake a chance, let it all goThere is no risk if you just Steal a KissBoy you better let it out and show meAnd hit or miss - Steal a KissTake a chance, let it all goThere is no risk if you just Steal a KissBoy you better let it out and show meAnd hit or miss - Steal a Kiss
