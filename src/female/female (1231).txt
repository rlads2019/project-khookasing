All God's children need traveling shoesDrive your problem from hereAll good people resd good booksNow your conscience is clearI hear you talk , girlNow your conscience is clearIn the morning when I wipe my browWipe the miles awayI like to think I can be so willedAnd never do what you sayI'll never hear youAnd never do what you sayLook my eyes are just hologramsLook your love has drawn red from my handsFrom my hands you know you'll never beMore than twist in my sobrietyMore than twist in my sobrietyMore than twist in my sobriety We just poked a little empty pieFor the fun the people had at nightLate at night don't need hostilityThe timid smile and pause to freeI don't care about their different thoughtsDifferent thoughts are good for meUp in arms and chaste and wholeAll God's children took their tollCup of tea.Take time to think.yeaTime to risk a life , a life , a lifeSweet and handsomeSoft and porkyYou pig out till you've seen the lightPig out till you've seen the lightHalf the people read the papersRead them good and wellPretty people nervous peoplePeople have got to sellNews you have to sell
