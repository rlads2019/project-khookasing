Is your smile genuineAre you that really kindDo you like money & what it can bringWhere would you wanna hideWhat would you seekWould you want what you thoughtwhat you want if no one can seeSee the pretty lights pretty smilesa long way from homeSee the wretched stars burnt-out sunOut on your ownSee our story come - sing alongWhat would you knowThis is your songIs your smile genuineAre you that really kindDo you like money & what it can bringWhere would you wanna hideWhat would you seekWould you want what you thoughtwhat you want if no one can seeIs your smile genuineAre you that really kindDo you like money & what it can bringWhere would you wanna hideWhat would you seek Would you want what you thoughtwhat you want if no one can seeSee the pretty lights pretty smilesa long way from homeSee the wretched stars burnt-out sunOut on your ownSee our story come - sing alongWhat would you knowThis is your songOh I know where I'd rather beSo I'm holding on & going strongJoin the race, I'll be first placeGive me glue, we'll be good as newSee the pretty lights pretty smilesa long way from homeSee the pretty lights pretty smilesa long way from homeSee the wretched stars burnt-out sunOut on your ownSee the wretched stars burnt-out sunOut on your ownSee our story come - sing alongWhat would you knowThis is your song
