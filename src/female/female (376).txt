孤單　縱使好友千萬陪我喝酒空間　縱使歡笑億萬亦覺擠滿了憂光陰怎不將一切也沖淡諠嘩聲怎麼仿似遮不去我的低嘆怎麼每到熱鬧時仍甚冷OH！可能當失去你至覺當天最美YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING可能當失去你至確當天最美YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING傻得很那天擁有之後隨意放手盲得很 我怎麼怎麼不珍惜便把你送走多麼的想跟你再一次可不可開恩一次准許我試多一次即使這已是極遲仍願試OH....可能當失去你至覺當天最美YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING可能當失去你方發現愛已死YOU WERE MY EVERYTHINGYOU WERE MY LIFEYOU WERE MY LOVE(YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING)YOU WERE MY LIFEYOU WERE MY EVERYTHING
