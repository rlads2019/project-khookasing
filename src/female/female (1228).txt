Tell me you love meTell me that you're mine againTell me you won't turn awayTurn like the seasonsTurn back to me once againCircling all the wayOnce you were my blue-eyed princeWaking love from an endless sleepYou made all of my wishes come trueTurning all of my dreams into youTurning and swirling and whirling 'round you againTwirling and curling 'round youTurning and burning and yearning for you againAll my life with youBut lately I'm losing sleepSomeone else is in your eyesWon't you turn back to me my loveWon't you stop telling me liesTurning and swirling and whirling 'round me againTwirling and curling 'round meTurning and burning and yearning for me again All my life with youIt is a chance, a romanceIt's a dance we doTurning in circles we goTurn like the seasonsTurn back to me once againNever let me goTell me you love meTell me that you're mine againTell me you won't turn awayTurn like the seasonsTurn back to me once againCircling all the wayTurning and swirling and whirling 'round me againTwirling and curling 'round meTurning and burning and yearning for me againAll my life with youTurning and swirling and whirling 'round me againTwirling and curling 'round meTurning and burning and yearning for me againAll my life with you
