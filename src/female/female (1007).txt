Met you by surprise,I didn't realize that my life would change foreverSaw you standing there,I didn't know I caredThere was something special in the air.Dreams are my realityThe only real kind of real fantasyIllusions are a common thingI try to live in dreamsIt seems as if it's meant to be.Dreams are my realityA different kind of reality I dream of loving in the nightAnd loving seems alright although it's only fantasy.If you do exist,honeydon'r resistShow me a new way of lovingTell me that it's trueShow me what to doI feel something special about you.Dreams are my realityA wonderous world where I like to beIllusions are a common thingI try to live in dreams although it's only fantasy.Dreams are my realityI like to dream of you close to meI dream of loving in the nightand loving you seems right perhaps that's my reality.
