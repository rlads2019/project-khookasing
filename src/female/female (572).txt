*If you don't know me by nowYou'll never, never, never know meAll the things that we've been throughYou should understand meLike I understand youNow baby I know the differenceBetween right and wrongI ain't gonna do nothin'To upset our happy homeOh, don't get so excitedWhen I comee home a little late at nightCause we only act like childrenWhen we argue, fuss and fight (Repeat *)We all got our own funny moodsI've got mineWoman, you got yours tooJust trust in meLike I trust in youAs long as we've been togetherThat should be so easy to doJust get yourself togetherOr we might as well say good-byeWhat good is a love affairWhen we can't see eye-to-eye(Repeat *)
