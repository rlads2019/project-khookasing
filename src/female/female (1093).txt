作詞：克麗絲叮作曲：孫盛希編曲：蔡侑良Sunset fades awayStreetlights start to blazeA turntable corner caféAs evening fades to grayRed brick alleywaysWinding like a mazeThese memories rewind, replayAnd I am farawayHe said to me that one dayHe'd meet me by the Milky WayImpossible to stay awayImpossible to stayBut please tell me that somedayOne dayPlayed this song for daysWandering in a hazeSoundtrack turned up all the wayA smile to end the dayHe said to me that one dayHe'd meet me by the Milky WayImpossible to stay awayImpossible to stayYou'll be back to me somedayOne dayHe said to me that one dayHe'd meet me by the Milky WayImpossible to stay awayImpossible to stayBut please tell me that somedayPlease tell me that somedayYou'll be back to me someday One day日漸漸落下街燈開始亮起來有黑膠唱片的轉角咖啡廳天色漸漸變灰紅磚小巷迷宮般蜿蜒回憶倒帶、播放然而已離我很遠他曾跟我說過，將來會在星空下相遇無法遠離也無法留下請告訴我，某天有一天這首歌重複播放很多天了徘徊著、迷惘著音樂開到最大聲努力用微笑結束這一天他曾跟我說過，將來會在星空下相遇無法遠離也無法留下你會回到我身邊，有朝一日他曾跟我說過，將來會在星空下相遇無法遠離也無法留下請告訴我，將來你會回到我身邊，總有一天
