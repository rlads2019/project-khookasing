Saturday of 1st DecemberI'm left with me and a 'friend'Counting tablesCounting crowsCounting the days I spend revolving the sun(If I could) Drive! Drive casuallyI'll drive myself to sanityI won't be walking all nightLive life as it isI'll live my life incessantlyI'll be nowhere out of sight Liberation!Relocation!I must get out of this houseLooking forwardLooking for youLooking for someone to jump into my carIt's hard enough to try to explainAnd if I did you won't understandIt's hard enought to try to fit itThere must be a somewhat better plan
