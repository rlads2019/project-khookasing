Could it be that we were not meant to be?I've cried enough tears to fill up a big seaBut I'm not the kind to live on miseryYet I don't want to be part of you historyI've tried to get close to youI've been by your side But it's always the case that I've never been trueIf nothing else works for you we'll meet againBut next time aroundNo, I won't be the sameFinally it's time that I, turn off the lightsLeave all behind that's yours and take what mineTry not to call or come ringing your bellCos it's something to do with my pride
