Tonight, tonightIt all begin tonightI saw you and the world went awayTonight, tonightThere's only you tonightWhat you areWhat you doWhat you sayTonight all day I had the feelingA miracle would happenI know now I was rightFor here you areAnd what was just a world is a starTonightTonight, tonight The world is full of lightWith suns and moons all over the placeTonight, tonightThe world is wide and brightGoing mad shooting sparks into spaceToday the world was just an addressA place for me to live inNo better than all rightBut here you areAnd what was just a world is a starTonightGood night, good nightSleep well and when you dreamDream of meTonight
