Here I stand in BressanoneWith the stars up in the skyAre they shining over BrennerAnd upon the other sideYou would be a sweet surrenderI must go the other wayAnd my train will carry me onwardThough my heart would surely stayWo my heart would surely stayNow the clouds are flying by meAnd the moon is on the rise I have left stars behind meThey were disamondsin your skiesYou would be a sweet surrenderI must go the other wayAnd my train will carry me onwardThough my heart would surely stayWo my heart would surely stayHere I stand in BressanoneWith the stars up in the skyAre they shining over BrennerThough my heart would surely stayWo my heart would surely stay
