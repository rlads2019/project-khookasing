* Knife cuts like a knife　How will I ever heal　I'm so deeply wounded　Knife cuts like a knife　You've cut away the heart of my lifeWhen I pretend wear a smile to fool my dearest friends Iwonder if they know it's just a showI'm on a stageDay and night I go through my charadesBut how can I disguiseWhat's in my eyesrepeat*I've tried and triedLocking up the pain I feel insideThe pain of wanting, wanting yourepeat*
