Morning has broken like the first morningBlackbird has spoken like the first birdPraise for the singing　Praise for the morningPraise for them springing fresh from the world破曉時分，猶如早晨的首次降臨　山鳥啼唱，猶如鳥兒的首次清啼讚美歌唱　讚美早晨　讚美他們在大地裡展現生機Sweet the rain's new fall，sunlit from heavenLike the first dewfall on the first grassPraise for the sweetness of the wet garden Sprung in completeness where his feet pass甘露初降，日照天際　猶如嫩綠草原的首次降露讚美花園滋潤的愉悅　腳步挪移，自在飛躍Mine is the sunlight　Mine is the morningBorn of the one light Eden saw playPraise with elation　Praise every morningGod's recreation of the new day我擁有陽光　我擁有早晨　伊甸園誕生一道生命之光喜悅地讚美　每早地讚美　上帝創造嶄新的一天
