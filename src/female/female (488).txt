There's a heroIf you look inside your heartYou don't have to be afraid of what you areThere's an answerIf you reach into your soulAnd the sorrow that you know will melt awayAnd then a hero comes alongWith the strength to carry onAnd you cast your fears asideAnd you know you can surviveSo when you feel like hope is goneLook inside you and be strongAnd you'll finally see the truth That a hero lies in youIt's a long roadWhen you face the world aloneNo one reaches out a hand for you to holdYou can find love if you search within yourselfAnd the emptiness you felt will disappearLord knowsDreams are hard to followBut don't let anyone tear them awayHold onThere will be tomorrowIn time you'll find the way
