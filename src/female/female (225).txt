Love is like a loser's gameI'll never play againI'm through with love foreverOh, like a fallin' starLove can leave a scarRaining in my heart babeYes it's trueI'm still missing you(Chorus)Broken heroes and fallin angelsBroken dreams a heart of stone There's no smoke babe without a fireI'm standing here aloneAll aloneHow much have I sacrificedMy heart aches deep insideIn the name of love babeAnd how much time and lonelinessI traded for a kissIt's raining in my heart babeYes, it's trueI'm still missing you
