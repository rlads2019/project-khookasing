作曲：童安格When we said goodbyeYou started so worried insideI could never loveThis way againThe time when you said we were throughI could never cry Again like I didThe time when you were gone and I felt aloneAll the broken hearts and dreamsWere over, my loveThere was nothing that we both could doTime keep dragging onForever's been goneYou know that my heart has been so alone.
