茹：I've been living with a shadow overheadI've been sleeping with a cloud above my bedI've been lonely for so longTrapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on冠:I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams awayJust in case I ever need them again somedayI've been setting aside timeTo clear a little space in the corners of my mind合:All I wanna do is find a way back into loveI can't make it through without a way back into loveOh oh oh茹:I've been watching but the stars refuse to shineI've been searching but I just don't see the signsI know that it's out thereThere's gotta be something for my soul somewhere冠:I've been looking for someone to shed some lightNot somebody just to get me through the night I could use some directionAnd I'm open to your suggestions合:All I wanna do is find a way back into loveI can't make it through without a way back into loveAnd if I open my heart againI guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end茹:There are moments when I don't know if it's realOr if anybody feels the way I feelI need inspirationNot just another negotiation合:All I wanna do is find a way back into loveI can't make it through without a way back into loveAnd if I open my heart to youI'm hoping you'll show me what to doAnd if you help me to start againYou know that I'll be there for you in the end
