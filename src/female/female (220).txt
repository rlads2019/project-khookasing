Reflections in the waterMemory is all I seeEverything's out of orderWanna build back the piecesWho am I supposed to beBefore time goes shorterQuick pause quick breathSteady feetAir I'm pulling inOne chance real hopeWhat I needNew day to beginEach day that I wake up I tell myselfBreathe in breathe outEach day that I wake up I start againBreathe in breathe outLeap through every raindropTraveling empty roads Takes a little bit of courageNo more resistanceLearning and letting goAll I need is enduranceQuick pause quick breathSteady feetAir I'm pulling inOne chance real hopeWhat I needNew day to beginEach day that I wake up I tell myselfBreathe in breathe outEach day that I wake up I start againBreathe in breathe outEach day that I wake up I tell myselfBreathe in breathe outEach day that I wake up I start againBreathe in breathe out
