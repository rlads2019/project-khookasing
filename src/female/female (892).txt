The rain, just never seems to bringthe joy, I feel the same,everlasting pain of my loss remainsMy heart, can't seem to learn to partthe hold you left your markall that I dreamed of now it seems so starkTho I told myself won't hold my breatha part of me was dyingthere is nothing left for me to do now, but give inIf you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without youif you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,I'd never let you goThe way, you left me on the trainI don't know what to sayI remember everything of that day I can't, believe we'd never danceI just need one more chanceto share the sunset our one last romanceTho I told myself won't hold my breatha part of me was dyingthere is nothing left for me to do now, but give inIf you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without youif you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,I'd never let you goIf you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would sing to you and tell you I won't live my life without youif you gave me, one chance to tell you how I was feelingI would hold your hand and look in your eyes and ya know,I'd never let you go
