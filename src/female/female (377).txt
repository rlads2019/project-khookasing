Whenever sang my songsOn the stage, on my ownWhenever said my wordsWishing they would be heardI saw you smiling at me.Was it real, or just my fantasy?You'd always be there in the cornerOf this tiny little barMy last night here for youSame old songs, just once moreMy last night here with you?Maybe yes, maybe noI kind of liked it your wayHow you shyly placed your eyes on meOh, did you ever knowThat I had mine on you?Darling, so there you areWith that look on your faceAs if you're never hurt As if you're never downShall I be the one for youWho pinches you softly but sure?If frown is shown, thenI will know that you are no dreamerSo let me come to youClose as I wanted to beClose enough for meTo feel your heart beating fastAnd stay there as I whisperHow I loved your peaceful eyes on meDid you ever knowThat I had mine on you?Darling, so share with meYour love if you have enoughYour tears if you're holding backOr pain if that's what it isHow can I let you knowI'm more than the dress and the voiceJust reach me out, thenYou will know that you are not dreaming
