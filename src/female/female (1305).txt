I look at you all see the love there that's sleepingWhile my guitar gently weepsI look at the floor and I see it need sweepingStill my guitar gently weepsI don't know why nobody told youhow to unfold your loveI don't know how someone controlled youthey bought and sold youI look at the world and I notice it's turningWhile my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learningStill my guitar gently weepsI don't know how you were divertedyou were perverted tooI don't know how you were invertedno one alerted youI look at you all see the love there that's sleepingWhile my guitar gently weepsI look at you allStill my guitar gently weeps
