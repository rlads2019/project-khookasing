So I was the one with all of the gloryWhile you were the one with all of the strainA beautiful face without a name , for so longA beautiful smile to hide the painDid you ever know that you're my heroAnd everything I would like to beI can fly higher than an eagleFor you are the wind beneath my wingsIt might have appeared to go unnoticedBut I've got it all here in my heartBut I've got it all here in my heartI want you to know I know the truthOf course I knowI would be nothing without youDid you ever know that you're my heroI can fly higher than an eagle For you are the wind beneath my wingsDid I ever tell you you're my heroYou're everything, everything I wish I could beI can fly higher than a eagleYou are the wind beneath my wingsYou are the wind beneath my wingsOh, wind beneath my wingsYou, youYou're the wind beneath my wingsFly...fly...fly awayYou let me fly so highOh, you, youYou, the wing beneath my wingsYou, the wing beneath my wingsFly...fly...So high against the skySo high I almost touched the skyThank you, thank youThank God for youThe wind beneath my wings
