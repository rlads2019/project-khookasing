With I had a colour TV set.I'd sit around all dayAnd kick my shoes of anywhereWhat is it about those pretty boys？I wish they'd come alive.And bring some colour to my roomLa la la ....Wish I had a colour TV setI'd sit around all day.And let the day turn into nightFunny people playing up todayWhat a joke it is.For them to see me from their screen La la la ....I wake in the morningJust to see the sun！Looked out the windowto see people passing by.But nothing! just nothingI think about the things to doI think about my colourful sweet baby！！Wish I had a colour TV set.Stay up late at nightDon't care what happens there and themI'm sick of people knocking at the doorJust me my TV set.Will stick together through the timesLa la la ....
