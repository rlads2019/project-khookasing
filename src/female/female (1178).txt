Here I am Under the spotlightsWithout the stage frightI'll sing for you＊Remember way before　I was so insecure　Without a focus　Without a sight　Many weary nights　I was down with troubles　I'm striving on　Sure and predestine　I'll be on my way　To be true　It's make believing＊＃If I should be a star tonight 　Make the best of me　Come hear how I feel　Let me have a voice　To sing with love From me to you　If time could stop　I'll take this moment to live with me　and take no regret　You will see＃REPEAT＊＃Temperamental feelingsthat come with every wordthat I sing from the top of my headDon't wanna be that someonewho just sing with their greedREPEAT＃
