I can hardly wait to hold you,Feel my arms around you.How long I have waited,Waited just to love you,Now that I have found you.Don't ever go.You've got that look of love. It's on your face.The look that time can't erase.You're mine tonight.Let this be just the start ofSo many nights like this.Let's take what lover's foundAnd then seal it with a kiss.I can hardly wait to hold you,Feel my arms around you.How long I have waited,Waited just to love you,Now that I have found you,Don't ever go.Don't ever go.I love you so
