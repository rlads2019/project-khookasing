＊AND IT'S TOO LATE BABY　NOW IT'S TOO LATE　曾亦盡了力　想去改變　但我盡心你不盡力　仍不可將結果扭轉 OH NO常幻覺跟你一再相處這屋中　沉醉於你的臂彎裡一起入夢但頃刻一切已失　我清醒了更心痛Repeat ＊ 明白一切補救方法已經遲　你不再給我溫暖　心不再一樣今天心都變灰　我不敢再寄厚望Repeat ＊DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I JUST CAN'T HELP ITOH　BABY IT'S TOO LATE MY BABYTOO LATE MY BABY oh yeahTOO LATE MY BABYIT'S TOO LATE MY BABY
