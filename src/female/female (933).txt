Only love can make a memoryOnly love can make a moment lastYou were there and all the world was youngAnd all its songs unsungAnd I remember you thenWhen love was allAll you were living forAnd how you gave that love to meOnly then I felt my heart was freeI was part of youAnd you were all of meWarm were the days and the nights of those yearsPainted in colors to outshine the sunOh, all the words and the dreams and the tearsLive in my rememberOnly love can make a memoryOnly love can make a moment lastLife was new there was a rang to live Each day a page to liveAnd I remember you thenWhen love was allAll you were living forAnd how you gave that love to meOnly then I knew my heart was freeI was part of youAnd you were all of meOnly love can make a memoryOnly love can make a moment lastLife was new there was a rang to liveEach day a page to liveAnd I remember you thenWhen love was allAll you were living forAnd how you gave that love to meOnly then I knew my heart was freeI was part of youAnd you were all of me
