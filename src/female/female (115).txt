The night is over, and we were soberyou said goodbye and I try not to be hurtSeems like forever, nothing has changedand I'll always be the same for youWhen you try to squeeze me tighteverything feels all so rightDon't tell me no more lies and your reason whyI've tried so many times to see me in your eyesbut I realize, oh I realizeThe night is over, and all is overA love so beautiful but we let it slip awayThe sound of my voicethe smile on my faceAnd I'll always be the same for you When you try to squeeze me tighteverything feels all so rightDon't tell me no more no more lies and your reason whyI've tried so many times to see me in your eyesbut I realize, oh I realizeThe night is over, and all is overA love so beautiful but we let it slip awayThe sound of my voicethe smile on my faceI'll always be the same for youAnd I'll always be the same for you
