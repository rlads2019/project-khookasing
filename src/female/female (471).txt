I've heard there was a secret chordthat David played, and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, Do you?It goes like this, the fourth, the fifthThe minor Fall, The major liftThe baffled king composing, hallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahYour faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty in the moonlight overthrew youShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throneand she cut your hair and from your lipsShe drew the halleujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahMaybe I've been here beforeI know this room, I've walked this floorI used to live alone before I knew youI've seen your flag on the marble arch love is not a victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahThere was a time you let me knowWhat's real and going on belowBut now you never show it to me, do you?And remember when I moved in youThe holy dove was moving tooAnd every breath we drew was HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahMaybe there's a God aboveAnd all I ever learned from loveWas how to shoot at someone who outdrew youIt's not a cry you can hear at nightIt's not somebody who's seen the lightIt's a cold and it's a broken HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, Hallelujah...
