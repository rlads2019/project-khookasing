Today it's gonna be okayCos the fortune teller said soSo I think it's safe to go outPut on my finest pair of shadesPack my bags I'llGo west to the seasideWho cares if it's gonna rain or shineCos the fortune teller said soSo there's nothing else that could go wrongSo what, if no one even caresPack my bads I'llGo up the mountainsDa da da ...If you feel the same as I do Come with meMaybe I'm just a little scaredNeurotic, paranoid's my nameEveryone has their own reasonsFeeling a little insecureGuess I'll need a breakOr change of seasonsMaybe it's gonna be okayCos for so long I've felt so downEverything just had to go wrongTill now, the fortune teller siadThat from now on it's luckThat will come my way
