Because simply becauseI'll open up and closed down on youThat I start to believe that it seemsThat it's okay to be so unkindRight before you came along I didn't realizeThere is so much for me to look outPacing back and forth between the shadows and lightsI can see the sun coming out finallyDid you see me cry?And when you asked what's wrong I said nothingI laughed too hard at the joke on TVAnd that was how we ended the night How long has it been?With all that bullshit I put you throughI don't even think you'll forgive all my sinsSo should I keep them all to myself?You are what you are someone that I don't deserveIt can no longer serve as a reminderDreaming bout outer space, shuttles and satellitesTake me far awaySomeone far away from hereI'll pack my bag I'll goI'll bear my own sorrowIt's easier when there'sNo one left to blameTo turn the lights on and off on and off
