Just had a bad dayHad car trouble on the highwayAnd my stupid boss don't like meSpilled hot coffee on my blue jeansI'm low on moneyAnd it ain't funnyBut it's still sunny outsideSo I keep on smilingI won't start wailingI just keep living my lifeCan't keep me down me downIt's only temporaryCan't make me frown me frownSo I ain't even worried'Cause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI won't cry for long'Cause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shoulders...Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.You can't find your girlfriendYour boyfriend left youBut the party's still going onEverybody here sayingDust your shoulders offSee em kissing in the kitchenBy bathroomButcha don't let it phase youGo hit the bar upGo and key his car upTell him that it's karmaCan't keep me down me downIt's only temporaryCan't make me frown me frownSo I ain't even worried 'Cause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI won't cry for long'Cause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shoulders...Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.I ain't tripping over dramaAll about my numbersTell' em get up outta my faceYou don't even know meYou don't even know meSave it for another dayI ain't tripping over dramaAll about my numbersTell' em get up outta my faceYou don't even know meYou don't even know meSave it for another dayNo big dealWin some you lose someBut life gets realWon't last forever'Cause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI won't cry for long'Cause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shoulders...Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.Dust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off.
