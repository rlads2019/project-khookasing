I've been cheated by you sinceI don't know whenSo I made up my mindIt must come to an endLook at me nowWill I ever learnI don't know howBut I suddenly lose controlThere's a fire within my soulJust one look and I can hear a bell ringOne more look and I forget everythingO-O-O-OhMamma miaHere I go againMy myHow can i resist youMamma miaDoes it show againMy my just how muchI've miss youYesI've been brokenheartedBlue since the day we partedWhy why did I ever let you goMamma mia now I really knowMy myI could never let you goI've been angry and sad aboutthe things that you doI can't count all the times thatI've told you we're throughAnd when you goWhen you slam the doorI think you know thatYou won't be away too longYou know that I'm not that strongJust one look andI can hear a bell ringOne more look andI forget everything o-o-o-ohMamma miaHere I go againMy myHow can i resist youMamma miaDoes it show againMy my just how muchI've miss youYesI've been brokenheartedBlue since the day we partedWhy why did I ever let you goMamma mia even if i sayBye bye leave me nowOr neverMamma miait's a game we playBey byeDoesn't mean foreverMamma miaHere I go againMy myHow can i resist youMamma miaDoes it show againMy my just how muchI've miss youYesI've been brokenheartedBlue since the day we partedWhy why did I ever let you goMamma miaNow I really knowMy myI could never let you goMamma miaNow I really knowMy myI could never let you go
