Touch can mean distance to some peopleTouch can mean prison or be like a cageI always thought that life sould be more simpleEspecially in this day and ageThey got the time, they got the needThe world's getting weird, the wolf's running freeBut that's another story, this is their storyBabes in the wood, eager and keenSoft as the fern underneath themWet to the skin from their own hot glow No more wolf at the windowTouch can mean a distance to some peopleTouch can mean I own you forever and a dayIf only life could be more simpleEspecially in this day and ageThey got the time, they got the needThe world's getting weird, the wolf's running freeBut that's another story, this is their storyBut touch can be a blessing to other peopleTouch can bring blossom to things that decayI think life should be that simpleEspecially in this day and age
