Remember the days, we set out together with faith?Remember the times, so fine,when we thought that nothing could stand in our way?Then things weren't the same, the life that we knew had to changeWe've struggled through the darkest storms, we thought we couldn't tameTogether we've tried, as we stood side by sideI knew we'd build a new world, a world of hope forever after(chorus)Deep in my heart I just know, right from the start we will growLook where we are, we've come so far and there's still a long long way to goAll of my heart, I will care. I'll play my part, I will shareWith family and friends, together we'll standAnd in the end, hand in hand, we will get thereSo now we begin, working together to win Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything.There's so much to do, there's so much we can contributeBy sharing just a little love, we will start again a newSo why don't we try? If we stand side by sideI know we'll build a new world, a world of hope for ever afterDeep in my heart I just know, right from the start we will growLook where we are, we've come so far and there's still a long long way to goAll of my heart, I will care. I'll play my part, I will shareWith family and friends, together we'll standAnd in the end, hand in hand, we will get thereSo now we begin, working together to winBelieving in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything.There's so much to do, there's so much we can contributeBy sharing just a little love, we will start again a newSo why don't we try? If we stand side by sideI know we'll build a new world, a world of hope for ever after
