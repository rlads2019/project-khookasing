She's waitingHe's lyingFor the moment of truth he's hidingSo maybeHe told meI'm not your perfect oneI'm sorryFor reallyThere is greater a chance we'll grow wearySo goodbyeIn my eyes, they cried September rainWhy did the sky above me look so down in sorrowWhen they said it was supposed to be blueI used to Be wiserNow the fact that I'm headingI'm hopingYou'd tell meYou need me by your sideWith my heartThough we're apartThere' a beauty of love inside meForever, it'll never leave me till I dieSo how am I supposed to live my lifePretending that there wad nothing about me and youYet there is nothing to doIn June I'll think about you
