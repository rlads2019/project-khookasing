Oh see you break your back and blend in what you wantA puppet on the strings drags himself into another runTurning and returning to the ghost townWhat're you hiding fromHaunted by the notion, make a motionCome and get things done Oh see you preen your feathers and blend in what you wantA puppet on the strings' reminding himself not to bloomTurning and returning to the ghost townWhat're you hiding fromHaunted by the notion, make a motionCome and get things done
