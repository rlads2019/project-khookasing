I'm losing all of itI'm trying to go on this pathBut you said I haven't get the jests也不是真的不要關心也不是真的想盡辦法任性而你懂不懂我 懂不懂其實我心裡都珍惜也不是全都不理不聽也不是硬要顛反事理 可每一次我的試著靠近都成了你看見的抗議I'm screaming. I'm losing all of itI'm trying to be perfect somedayBut 'til now it's still in vainI'm bearing I'm losing all of itI'm trying to be understoodBut you said I haven't seen it yetI'm screaming, I'm losing all of itI'm trying to go on this pathBut you said I haven't get the jestsI'm losing all of itI'm trying to be understoodbut you said I haven't seen the pointsI'll try it out I'll try it outI'm trying out sometimeI'll try it out someday
