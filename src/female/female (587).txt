A veil has lifted that shrouded my eyesThe folds that lay over me no longer lieYour infinity is revealed to meIt shines in your infinite smileIt was like a gift floating down through the darkA dove finding rest in the leaves of my heartA feeling inside, an invisible guideHad shown me a way to surviveIndescribable nightIndescribable nightIndescribable nightIs it you?You and me in the circle of everyday life Climbing through moments of death and delightNow I've found my good night in the spiral of lightThat shines in your intimate smileIndescribable nightIndescribable nightIndescribable nightSailor oh sailor won't you be proudTo now find a light in the deadliest cloudThe wisdom you've found, a surrendering soundSings through the surrendering nightIndescribable nightIndescribable nightIndescribable nightIs it you?
