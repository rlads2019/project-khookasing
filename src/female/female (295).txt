* Even though we ain't got momeyI'm so in love with you, honeyEverything will bring a chain of loveIn the morning when I riseYou bring a tear of joy to my eyesAnd tell me everything's gonna be alrightSeems as though a month ago I was baby kaiNever got high, or was a sorry guy But now a smile, a face, a girl that shares my nameNow we're through with the gameThis world'll never be the samePisces, virgo rising, is a very good signStronger kind, and the little boy is mineNow I see a family where there once was noneAnd now we've just begunAnd we're gonna fly to the sunLove a girl who holds the world in a paper cupDrink it up, love her and she'll bring you luckAnd if you find she helps your mindBuddy take her homeYeah, don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own
