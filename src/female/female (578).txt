Imagine there's no heavenIt's easy if you tryNo hell below usAbove us only skyImagine all the people living for todayImagine there's no countriesIt isn't hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion tooImagine all the people living life in peace You may say, I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope some day you'll join usAnd the world will be as oneImagine no possessionsI wonder if you canImagine all the peopleSharing all the worldYou may say, I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope some day you'll join usAnd the world will live as one
