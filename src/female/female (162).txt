It's been more than a yearBut feels more like foreverYou are still on my mindYou're still one of a kindThat no other men can replaceOh you're so much more than themThey've all become just friendsThey just don't understandThe way you understandBut now you're gone cos I've treated you wrongNow I'm thinkingEvery other ways for me to get youGet you back into my lifeBut I don't know where you areI don't know where to startYou could be very farOr you could just live nearbySo for now I'mLooking up my dictionary tryingTo find some unordinary words To say baby I'm sorryCould you please forgive meOh babyWon't you please come back into my lifeLife's never been the sameI've learnt it the hard wayThey say no pain no gainBut I've gained nothing but painI know you're goneBut I still can't move onIt's killing me to think that you might be inBe in some other girl's armsI don't know if I canTake it like a manI don't think that I canWalk away or just pretendCan't believeThat your girl's not meThat your girl's not meOh baby won't you please come back into my life
