Don't know where to begin,I just can't pretendI've been holding this in,afraid to lose a friendBut I let it slip when I fell all over you last time we metAnd now the word is outI can't take it back,no,noIt's out in the openI told you everythingNow I wait 'till I know how you feelDon't ask me to act,go on Like nothing has happenedNow that I gave my heart away like thatI can't take it backWell it's out og my heart and in your handsAs the hourglass drops its final grain of sandI'm holding out hope that stars in your eyes are gonna fall for me at lastI take the chanceI let down my guardAnd I'll have to carry onI've gone too far
