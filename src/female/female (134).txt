Last night my little girl came to my bedroomI heard her whisper softly from the door'Mommy , I can't sleep cause I miss papaDoes papa miss me like he did before ?I took her in my arms and then I told her'Darling , papa misses you the same'But little girls and mommies cry with teardropsAngels cry with roses and with rainAngels cry roses and rain 　 Angels don't know any painSo darling when you hear your papa's nameThink of angels , roses , and rain and rainAngels , roses , and rainThis morning she was playing in the kitchen Then she took her doll and went outsideI watched her as she walked among the rosesI saw a little sadness in her eyesBut then I heard the rain drop on the windowAnd softly as the clouds that moved aboveMy little girl picked up her doll and whispered'That's the way my papa sends his love !Angels cry roses and rain 　 Angels don't know any painSo darling when you hear your papa's nameThink of angels , roses and rain and rainAngels cry roses and rain 　 Angels don't know any painSo darling when you hear your papa's nameTheink of angels , roses , and rainAngels , roses and rain 　 Angels , roses and rain
