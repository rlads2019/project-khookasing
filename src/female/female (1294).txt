When Can My Heart Beat AgainWhen Does The Pain Ever EndWhen Do The Tears Stop From Running OverWhen Does You'll Get Over It BeginI Hear What You're Sayin'But I Swear That It's Not Making SenseSo When Can I See YouWhen Can I See You AgainWhen Can My Heart Beat AgainWhen Can I See You Again And When Can I Breathe Once AgainWhen Can I See You AgainWhen Does My Someday BeginWhen I'll Find Someone AgainAnd What If I Still Am Not Truly OverWhat Am I Supposed To Do ThenPlease Hear What I'm Sayin'Even If,If It's Not Making SenseSo When Can I See You
