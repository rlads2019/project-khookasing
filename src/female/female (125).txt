A long long time agoI can still rememberHow that music used to make me smileAnd I knew if I had my chanceThat I could make those people danceAnd maybe they'd be happy for a whileBut February made me shiverwith every paper I'd deliverBad news on the doorstepI couldn't take one more stepI can't remember if I criedWhen I read about his widowed brideBut something touched me deep insideThe day the music diedSo...*Bye, bye Miss American PieDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dryThem good ole boys were drinking whiskey and ryeSinging this'll be the day that I dieThis'll be the day that I dieDid you write the book of loveAnd do you have faith in God aboveIf the Bible tells you so?Now do you believe in rock and roll?And Can music save your mortal soul?And can you teach me how to dance real slow?Well, I know that you're in love with him'cause I saw you dancing in the gymYou both kicked off your shoesMan, I dig those rhythm and bluesI was a lonely teenage broncin' buckWith a pink carnation and a pickup truckBut I knew I was out of luckThe day the music diedI started singing(*)Now, for ten years we've been on our ownAnd moss grows fat on a rolling stoneBut that's not how it used to beWhen the jester sang for the king and queenIn a coat he borrowed from James DeanAnd a voice that came from you and meOh and while the king was looking downThe jester stole his thorny crownThe courtroom was adjournedNo verdict was returnedAnd while Lenin read a book on MarxThe quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the darkThe day the music diedWe were singing(*)Helter skelter in a summer swelterThe birds flew off with a fallout shelterEight miles high and falling fastLanded foul on the grassThe players tried for a forward passWith the jester on the sidelines in a castNow the half-time air was sweet perfumeWhile sergeants played a marching tuneWe all got up to danceOh, but we never got the chance'Cause the players tried to take the fieldThe marching band refused to yieldDo you recall what was revealedThe day the music died?We started singing(*)Oh, and there we were all in one placeA generation lost in spaceWith no time left to start againSo come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quickJack Flash sat on a candlestick'Cause fire is the devil's only friendAnd as I watched him on the stageMy hands were clenched in fists of rageNo angel born in hellCould break that Satan's spellAnd as the flames climbed high into the nightTo light the sacrificial riteI saw Satan laughing with delightThe day the music diedHe was singing(*)I met a girl who sang the bluesAnd I asked her for some happy newsBut she just smiled and turned awayI went down to the sacred storeWhere I'd heard the music years beforeBut the man there said the music wouldn't playAnd in the streets the children screamedThe lovers cried, and the poets dreamedBut not a word was spokenThe church bells all were brokenAnd the three men I admire mostthe Father, Son, and the Holy GhostThey caught the last train for the coastThe day the music diedAnd they were singing(*)
