If you say my eyes are beautifulIt's because they're looking at youAnd if you could only see yourself,You'd feel the same way too.You could say that I am a dreamerWho's had a dream come true,If you say my eyes are beautifulIt's because they're looking at you.If you wonder why I'm smilin'It's because I'm happy with youAnd the warm sensations touch my heartAnd fill me through and through,I could hold you close foreverAnd never let you goIf you say my eyes are beautiful,It's because I just love you so.Now, my heart is an open doorWon't you come inside for moreYou give love so sweetly now,Take my love,Take me completely now.If you say my eyes are beautifulIt's because they're looking at youAnd my eyes are just the windows,For my feelings to come through,And by far you are more beautifulThan anything I ever knew,If you say my eyes are beautiful (X3)It's because they're looking at you 歌詞中譯 -【如果你說我的眼睛很美麗】如果你說我的眼睛很美麗那是因為它們正在注視著你如果你只能看見你自己你也會那麼覺得你可以說 我是一個幻想者我的夢想成真了如果你說我的眼睛很美麗那是因為它們正在注視著你如果你正在想為什麼我在笑那是因為 我能跟你在一起很高興滿足我滿足我我會永遠跟你保持得很近永遠不讓你離開如果你說我的眼睛很美麗那是因為我只愛你 所以現在我的心是一扇敞開的門難道你不想進來要更多的麼現在你給我的愛 很甜蜜現在接受我的愛 接受我全部的愛如果你說我的眼睛很美麗那是因為它們正在注視著你我的眼睛就像窗戶一樣讓我的情感流淌離遠看 你更漂亮比任何我所知道的事物如果你說我的眼睛很美麗如果你說我的眼睛很美麗如果你說我的眼睛我的眼睛很美麗那是因為 它們在注視著你
