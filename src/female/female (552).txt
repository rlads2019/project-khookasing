If I should stay　I'll only be in your waySo I'll go　But I'll knowI'll think of you every step of the wayAnd I will always love youI will always love youYou　My darling　You bittersweet memoriesThat is all　I'm taking with meSo goodbye　Please don't cryWe both know I'm not what you needAnd I will always love you I will always love youI hope life treats you kindAnd I hope you have all you dreamed ofAnd I wish you joy and happinessBut above all this wish you loveAnd I will always love youI will always love you　I will always love youI will always love you　I will always love youI will always love you　You darling I love youI'll always　I'll always love you
