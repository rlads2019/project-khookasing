And if she asks you why, you can tell herthat I told you that I'm tired of castles in the air.I've got a dream. I want the world to share ,and castle walls just lead me to despair.Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky.A dream comes true. I'll live there till I die.I'm asking you to say my last good bye.The love we knew ain't worth another try.Save me from all the troble and the pain.I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.Tell her the reasons why I can't remain perhapsshe'll understand if you tell it to her plain. Oh, but how can words express the feel of sunlightin the morning in the hills. away from city strife.I need a country womam for my wife I'm city born,but I love the country life. For I can not be partof the cocktail generation. Partners waltz devoid ofall romance. The music plays and everyone must dance.I'm bowing now. I need a second chance. Save me fromall the trouble and the pain. And if she asks you why,you can tell her that I told you that I'm tired ofcastles in the air. I've got a dream.I want the world to share ,and castle wallsjust lead me to despair. Hm, la la la la
