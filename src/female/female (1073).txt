I'm sipping on the sounds of the afternoon,When the wind blows out I'll breathe it and out againAnd listen to the overture with youOne last time to sit down and watch the world in stereoThen the chalk lines and the bass lines theyDrew straight lines onto the pavementAnd they curved up and they fell down and they wrote upWhat we missed out and what I could have been thenWhat we could have been thenAnd sometime somewhere when we start to healOur hearts will follow there where our new pressed bodies feelPrefectly still insideNow we're singleI drew a pretty little memory of us and I held it out and I held it upI let it breathe and put it back into my pocket We'd take it out for special occasions where you and me were feeling graciousAnd we'd pretend it looked like Christmas all rosy and cleanThen you'd see how things change,how they'd be,if we'd stayedAnd she'll make you happier than me and we'd see thatSo I'll smile and you'll leave and I'll do my best to make believe,In the inconsequence and words and all those other thingsThen we'll begin to get undressed and shed our skinLet them start their own livesMake a way out to the distance where our new pressed bodies liePrefectly still insideNow we're singleThen we'll begin to get undressed and shed our skinLet them start their own livesMake a way out to the distance where our new pressed bodies liePrefectly still insideNow we're singleI'm sipping on the afternoon
