Love soft as an easy chairLove fresh as the morning airOne love that is shared by twoI have found with youLike a rose under the April snowI was always certain love would growLove ageless and evergreenSeldom seen by two You and I will make each night a firstEvery day a beginningSpirits rise and their dance is unrehearsedThey worm and excit us 'cause we have the brightest loveTwo lights that shine as oneMorning glory and midnight sunTime we've learned to sail aboveTime won't change the meaning of one loveAgeless and ever evergreen
