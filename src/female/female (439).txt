As I walked out over London BridgeOne misty morning earlyI overtheard a fair pretty maidWas lamenting for her GeordieO my Geordie will be hanged in a golden chainT'is not the chain of manyHe was born of King's royal breedAnd lost to a virtuous ladyGo bridle me , my milk white steedGo bridle me , my ponyI will ride to London's courtAnd to plead for the life of GeordieO my Geordie never stole nor cow nor calfHe never hurted any Stole sixteen of the King's royal deerAnd he sold them in BohennyTwo pretty babies have I bornThe third lies in my bodyI'd freely part with them everyoneIf you'd spare the life of GeordieThe judge looked over his left shoulderHe said：Fair maid I'm sorrySaid：Fair maid you must be goneFor I can not pardon GeordieO my Geordie will be hanged in a golden chainT'is not the chain of manyStole sixteen of the King's royal deerAnd he sold them in Bohenny
