Town after town on I travelPass through faces I know and know notLike a bird in flight, sometimes I toppleTime and time again, just farewellsDonde voy, donde voyDay by day, my story unfoldsSolo estoy, solo estoyAll alone as the day I was bornTill your eyes rest in mine, I shall wanderNo more darkness I know and know notFor your sweetness I traded my freedom Not knowing a farewell awaitsYou know, hearts can be repeatedly brokenMaking room for the harrows to comeAlong with my sorrows I buriedMy tears, my smile, your nameDonde voy, donde voySongs of lovetales I sing of no moreSolo estoy, solo estoyOnce again with my shadows I roamDonde voy, donde voyAll alone as the day I was bornSolo estoy, solo estoyStill alone with my shadows I roam
