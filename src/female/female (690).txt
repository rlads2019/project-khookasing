If you close your eyes , the dream could last foreverKeep that lovely smile & think of me , whateverAll the people are working , or maybe having lunchI hope they would stay away from meIf you close your eyes , the dream could last foreverLeave the windows shut , don't need sunlight , not everOh , someday I know someone will come and save my soulFrom being so dry for so longLet it rain , let it rain , let it rain ,Let it rain on me let it rainIf you close your mouth , our love could last forever Do your daily things , so I could read my paperAll the people are happy and they're having such luckI wish it could happen to meIf you close your mouth , our love could last foreverI will do your shirt , so you can do whateverOh , someday I know someone will come and knock my doorI'll step out , I'll look out , to find the sky fade to greyLet it rain , let it rain , let it rain ,let it rain Let it rain on meLet it rain , let it rain , let it rainlet it rain Rain on me .. .Oh , let it rainÔºÅ
