Every morning she wakes up and walks out of the doorand then she buys her cigarettes and does not see him anymore.Every afternoon she takes a walk to get awayIt's just another day to struggle not to think of yesterday.Every night she lays in bed pretending she's at sleepand then she says a little prayer while she turns her head to weep.Everyday, every person walks out of their door.Everyday, every person lives not knowing what the hell for!! 老歌和相片裡的昨天　唇膏和鏡子裡的今天　鮮花將凋謝的明天曾經期待的每一天　輕快和放縱的晴天　沉默和徘徊的陰天躲藏和靜止的雨天　已經遺忘的每一天　喔　每天　每天哪天值得紀念　哪個人不能挽回　哪天曾經許願　哪個人只能夢裡再相見　有些人留下　有些人離開　所有人都變老的每天有些事還在上演　有些成為永遠　摸索未來的每天　有些人流浪有些人承擔　所有人都孤單的每天　有些錯不明白　有些愛不重來不想反悔的每天Oh~每天 Oh~每天
