I never knew what I had lostTill you were thousand miles awayI laid out all the memoriesWandering why I let you go away in tearsWandering why I pushed you awayTell all the damage had been doneThen knew I'd lost the best of meCos you loved me the mostCos you're all the things that I've been yearning forCos you knew me the mostCos it hurts so bad when you're not aroundI close my eyes so I won't seeThe fact that you're not coming back Shattered dreams and broken heartsLeft in pieces for the night to pick them upOh then I'll get carried awayPutting them back togetherYet they never looked so incompleteCos you loved me the mostCos you're all the things that I've been yearning forCos you knew me the mostCos it hurts so bad when you're not aroundWas love just passing by?Were we only not meant to be?When time gets to the truth so sunddenlyI just don't want to believe....
