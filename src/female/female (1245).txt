Starry , starry night 　 paint your palette blue and greyLook out on a summer's dayWith eyes that know the darkness in my soulShadows on the hills , sketch the trees and the daffodilsCatch the breeze and the winter chillsIn colors on the snowy linen landNow I understand what you tried to say to meHow you suffered for your sanity 　 How you tried to set hem freeThey would not listen , they did not know howPerhaps , they'll listen nowStarry , starry nightFlaming flowers that brightly blazeSwirling clouds in violet hazeReflect in Vincent's eyes of china blueColors changing hue, morning fields of amber grainWeathered faces lined in painAre soothed beneath the artist's loving handNow I understand what you tried to say to meHow you suffered for you sanity 　 And how you tried to set them free They would not listen , they did not know howPerhaps , they'll listen nowFor they could not love you 　 and still you love was trueAnd when no hope was left inside on that starry ,starry night 　 You took your life as lovers often doBut I could have told you , VIncentThis wourd was never meant for one as beautiful as youStarry , Starry night 　 Portraits hung in empty hallFrameless heads on namesless wallsWith eyes that watch the world and can't forgetLike the strangers that you've metThe ragged man in ragged clothesThe silver thorn of bloody roseLie crushed and broken on the virgin snowNow I think I know what you tried to say toHow you suffered for your sanityThen how you tried to set them freeThey would not listen , they're not listening stiffPerhaps, they never will
