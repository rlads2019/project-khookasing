Her eyes like windows trickle in rainUpon the pain getting deeperThough my love wants to relieve her.She walks alone from wall to wall,Lost in her hall she can't hear me, Though I know she likes to be near me.Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.She sits in her corner by the door.There must be more I can tell herIf she really wants me to help her.I'll do what I can to show her the wayAnd maybe one day I will free herThough I know no-one can see her.Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.
