Somewhere over the rainbow, way up highThere's a land that I heard of once in a lullabySomewhere over the rainbow, skies are blueAnd the dreams that you dare to dream really do come trueSomeday I'll wish upon a starAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind meWhere troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney topsThat's where you'll find meSomewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds flyBirds fly over the rainbowWhy then, oh why can't I?If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbowWhy, oh why can't I?
