It won't be easy, you'll think it strangeWhen I try to explain how I feelThat I still need your love after all that I've doneYou won't believe meAll you will see is a girl you once knewAlthough she's dressed up to the ninesAt sixes and sevens with youI had to let it happen, I had to changeCouldn't stay all my life down at heelLooking out of the window, staying out of the sunSo I chose freedomRunning around, trying everything newBut nothing impressed me at allI never expected it toDon't cry for me ArgentinaThe truth is I never left youAll through my wild daysMy mad existenceI kept my promiseDon't keep your distance And as for fortune, and as for fameI never invited them inThough it seems to the world they were all I desiredThey are illusionsThey're not the solutions they promised to beThe answer was here all the timeI love you and hope you love meDon't cry for me ArgentinaDon't cry for me ArgentinaThe truth is I never left youAll through my wild daysMy mad existenceI kept my promiseDon't keep your distanceHave I said too much?There's nothing more I can think of to say to youBut all you have to do is look at meTo know that every word is trueDon't cry for me Argentina
