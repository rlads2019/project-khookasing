You don't bring me flowersYou don't sing me love songsYou hardly talk to me anymoreWhen you come through the doorAt the end of the dayI remember whenYou couldn't wait to love meUsed to hate to leave meNow after lovin' me late at nightWhen it's good for youAnd you're feeling alrightWell you just roll overAnd you turn out the lightAnd you don't bring me flowers anymore It used to be so naturalTo talk about foreverBut 'used to be's' don't count anymoreThey just lay on the floor'Til we sweep them awayAnd baby, I rememberAll the things you taught meI learned how to laughAnd I learned how to cryWell I learned how to loveEven learned how to lieYou'd think I could learnHow to tell you goodbye'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore
