You look in my eyes, and I get emotional inside,I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart.And after all this time, you'd think that I,I wouldn't feel the same.But time melts into nothing, and nothing's changed.Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find.You know that I, I'm not the desparate type.If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp,I'll steal (hold) it with both hands.It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance. *I still believe, someday you and mewill find ourselves in love again.I had a dream, someday you and mewill find ourselves in love again.If you believe in forever, feel what-I-have inside!Then you must know that we will love again.If you believe in true love, never have to end.Then we must know that we will love again.Repeat*
