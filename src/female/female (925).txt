No need to beWorried, I'll seeWandering far, far awayThere's too much to seeBut I am too sleepyI'll happily follow you, falling sunWake me, when weCan go out and beWanderers far, far awayTogether we'll hold handsWhatever happensI'm happy to be there with youBirds fly and go by The daylight, all myWorries are far, far awayHolding our handsWe'll see what happensI'll happily follow you, falling sunFinally I seeI'm not too sleepyOh my! The sights to be seenSliver of silverThe moon shows and it glowsOnce the night comes to lifeOnce the night comes to lifeSleepy but saferRight now I savourMy pillow and silk linen sheets
