Turn down the light, turn up the radioThere's a fire in your eyes and it's keeping me warmHold on to me like it was yesterdayWhen we both felt our spirits collideI remember that moment being struck down by lightningSince the first time I saw your face and you smiledCome and lay down with me in the space that's between usFeel the magic that keeps love aliveThis time will be like the first timeClose your eyes and soon we'll be thereNo man could ever guess what you're feelingTurn a spark to a flameMake a wish　Close your eyesWon't you start all over againJust like the first time that you touched my skinAll over againI tasted heaven take me there againAll over againYour smile, your touch, your tasteIt turns me on and on and onThen I fall in love with you all over again Come and step through the starsTake a ride through the universeAs long as we're hereLet's take the whole thing inWhat I'm trying to say is that you're so beautifulLet me say it all over againThis time it can be like the first timeClose your eyes pretty soon we'll be thereNo man could ever guess what you're feelingTurn a spark to a flameMake a wish　Close your eyesWon't you start all over againJust like the first time that you touched my skinAll over againI tasted heaven take me there againAll over againYour smile, your touch, your tasteIt turns me on and on and onThen I fall in love with youThen I fall in love with youI keep falling in love with you all over againAll over again　All over againAll over again
