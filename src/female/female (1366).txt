Here you stand with tears in your eyesCrying into my armsPleading with me to take you backTeasing me with your charmsBut you got a nerve to come around hereAfter all you've said and doneI thought I had seen everythingObviously , I was wrong'Cause where were you when the sun went down ?Skies turned dark and greyWhere were you when the north winds blewHoney , tell me where were you ?I heard you were living down in BrazilWhth them high class friends of mineI can't believe I was so naive Did I never once cross your mind ?You told them all I was down and outMy existence you even deniedOh , what pleasure it gives me nowTo know that you're bleeding insideYou were my life , you were my breathYou were every move I ever madeBut recently my opinion's changedThe joke's on you I'm afraid'Cause I have a man so beautifulFor you I could no longer waitPlease go away , you may spoil everythingYour love has turned up too lateGo away , go away ; please , please go awayI loved you once , I don't love you nowPlease , please go away
