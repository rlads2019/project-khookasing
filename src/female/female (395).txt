No more runningWe are on the edgeOf what could be the endDon't come any closer to meI guarantee youThat's not what you wantI'm sure you thoughtThat I would just lay downBut you were wrongGive me all you gotDon't hold nothing backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shotI'll just give it backI'm on the winning sideWe won't be defeatedWo Oh Oh Oh OhI'm not afraid to dieCause life is a battleBut fighting me it'll be like fighting shadowsNo SurrenderI know how this endsI've been thereAnd it doesn't look good for youDon't come any closer to meI guarantee youThat's not what you wantI'm sure you thoughtThat I would just lay downBut you were wrongGive me all you gotDon't hold nothing backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shotI'll just give it backI'm on the winning sideWe won't be defeated Wo Oh Oh Oh OhWo Oh Oh Oh OhI'm not afraid to dieCause life is a battleBut fighting me it'll be like fighting shadows(Rap)Okay. It's all about survivalI'm doing whatever's liableTo spend a day and a night with me, probably could write a novelI'm going through hell and back, so every room got a BibleMy enemies and my rivals is probably within a mileI'm readyThey want me to lay downOr stay down but that ain't my fate nowI'm a hundred percent if you're testing my faithThat I'm from a city where war is a playgroundI've been living right and wrongHonestly, it's just so much to sayBut only God could judge meIf I die today, it's Judgment DayStraight upGive me all you gotDon't hold nothing backPromise you you're gonna need itTake your best shotI'll just give it backI'm on the winning sideWe won't be defeatedWo Oh Oh Oh OhWo Oh Oh Oh OhI'm not afraid to dieCause life is a battleBut fighting me it'll be like fighting shadows
