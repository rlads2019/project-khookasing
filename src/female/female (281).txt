I was alright for a while　I could smile for a while　But when i saw youLast night　Your held my hand so tight　As you stopped to say helloOh you wished me well　You couldn't tell　That i've been cryingOver you　Crying over you　And you said so longLeft me standing all alone　Alone and crying crying cryingCrying to understand　But the touch of your handCan start me crying　I thought that i was over youBut it's true　I love you even more　Than i did beforeBut darling what can i do　For you don't love meAnd i'll always be　Crying over you　Crying over youYes now you're gone　And from this moment on　 I'll be cryingCrying crying crying　Crying crying o-over you
