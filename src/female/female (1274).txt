Reaching out to you in the dead of the nightNo matter where I go, always end up by your sideAt the end of this journey, time has led me backBack to my home, now I found the way back homeno matter how I shut it out,like a drawer it opens againand when you fly up to the skysomehow you always end up with me and all the times I let you go,I know they're all the same oh no ohThe countless roads that led me away, it's you I found on the wayAlthough I empty out the heart, afraid that this would be the lastthe steps my feet would take, would always lead to youSo stop, just stop.Reaching out to you in the dead of the nightNo matter where I go, always end up by your sideAt the end of this journey, time has led me backBack to my home, now I found the way back homeQuietly open up the doorAnd take your memories out through the broken shattered timeshow are you're shining brightYou live entrapped in thisAstray and lonely heartSo stop, just stop.Reaching out to you in the dead of the nightNo matter where I go, always end up by your sideAt the end of this long journey, time has led me backBack to my home, now I found the way back hometrying to search the world for all of meto write this story that only you completeI'd lose it all my love, coz you're all that I needall the lights are turned out, please could you hold me close?Close your eyes, hold them tight, silently I'll make my way,Closer to you,In my heart, there you will stayI don't need just anybody, you're the only onewait until you're home, til that day then I'm not done.
