Baby,when I'm feeling blueI keep thinking of youMaybe one day you will seeMy sweet dreams come trueWhen I call you on the phoneI get worried insideTry so hard to tell the wordsI'm longing to sayWhenever I meet you, girlI don't know what to sayI just love the way you smile that makes me feel fineWhen I get so close to youI can feel your heartbeatHow I love to see your eyesLooking so shyEverything is clear to see thatYou are in love with meGiving me a destiny that I can't reachBeing with a lady like youI'll never ask for moreGive me something I can hold onTil the end of time
