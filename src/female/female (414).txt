I stand alone in the darknessThe winter of my life came so fastMemories go back to childhoodTo days I still recallOh how happy I was thenThere was no sorrow there was no painWalking through the green fieldsSunshine in my eyes I'm still there everywhereI'm the dust in the windI'm the star in the northern skyI never stayed anywhereI'm the wind in the treesWould you wait for me foreverWould you wait for me foreverWill you wait for me forever
