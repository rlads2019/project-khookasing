My friend, I know I'll be there if you're feeling blueMy friend, even though we're worlds apartWe might be walking in two directionsBut we know where each is heading toSo you can laugh all wantLet yourself be free. I won't let you downDo what you want.Live out your big dreams. I'd understandSay what you want.Let yourself be free, let your heart guide youCry if you want.I won't desert you. I won't be far away....
