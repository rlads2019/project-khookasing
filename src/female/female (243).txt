And I can change the world,I will be the sunlight in your universe.You would think my love was really something good,Baby if I could change the world.And if I could be queen,Even for a day,I'd take you as my king;I'd have it no other way.And our love would rule This kingdom we had made.Till then I'd be a fool,Wishing for the day...That I can change the world,I would be the sunlight in your universe.You would think my love was really something good,Baby if I could change the world.Baby if I could change the world.I could change the world,I would be the sunlight in your universe.You would think my love was really something good,Baby if I could change the world.Baby if I could change the world.Baby if I could change the world.
