If a man could be two places at one time, I'd be withyou.Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.If the world should stop revolving spinning slowlydown to die,I'd spend the end with you.And when the world wasthrough.Then one by one the stars would all go out,and you and I would simply fly away.If a picture paints a thousand words,Then why can't I paint you?The words will never show.the you I've come to know.if a face could launch a thousand ships,Then where am I to go?There's no one home but you,You're all that's left metoo. And when my love for life is running dry,You come and pour yourself on me.If a man could be two places at one time, I'd be withyou.Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.If the world should stop revolving spinning slowlydown to die,I'd spend the end with you.And when the world wasthrough.Then one by one the stars would all go out,and you and I would simply fly away.[中譯]If如果有人可以同時身處兩地　我願與你同在無論明日今日長伴你左右如果世界停止轉動　慢慢停止希望能陪你到老　直至世界末日星辰的閃爍逐漸熄滅你我將比翼雙飛如果畫能繪出千言萬語為何我無法彩繪出你的影像千言萬語無法說出　我所認識的你如果臉上的表情可以載滿所有的負荷起航那我該何去何從心中只有你　停留在我心裡當我此生的愛漸漸枯萎你前來將愛傾注我心中如果人可以同時身處兩地　我願與你同在無論明日今日長伴你左右如果世界停止轉動　慢慢停止希望能陪你到老　直至世界末日星辰的閃爍逐漸熄滅你我將比翼雙飛
