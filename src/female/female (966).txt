Falling leaves turn to goldSilver flowers on my windowSpirit of the fading year gently slips awayHe knows not whereHe cannot seeNaked trees in the skyStars are Shinning clear and cold Minstrel of the ages sings of words so long agoThat age-old tune without a nameNo one knowsIn the white falling snowThe pilgrim travels onHis face toward the sunBeyond the open road he travels onPass the lamp shinning windowsFaces by the fireBefore the midnight hourChristmas time has come around againGo to sleep little childGo to sleep little child you shouldn't be awakeGo to sleep little childTime to let the night go byWaiting for the sound of a magic sleighThe chimney is not too tall they sayOr the roof too high for a reindeer to flyNo not too high for a reindeer to fly
