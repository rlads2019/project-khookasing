I'm missing youI'm feeling blueIn the nightWith starry skiesAnd starry eyesShining brightWalking in your sleepWith love you come to meSilently＊Sliently you come away　Won't you stay another day　Silently you run away　Forever and ever 　How silently you took my love awayI'll be waitingI'll be prayingFor the dayWhten you will learnAnd will returnFor alwaysTalking in your sleepOf love you sing to meHeavenlySilently you come awayWon't you stay another daySilently you run awayForever and everHow sliently you took my love awayRepeat ＊,＊
