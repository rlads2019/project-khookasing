You're losing your mindEverything seems to be falling apartTears trapped in your eyesYou swallow them down to fill up your heartBut take a look aroundYou don't have to feel downHappiness is round the cornerSavor all the sweetnessLose all your bitternessMaybe that's the key to happinessYeah yeahShake off some saltinessBear with the sournessThat's half of the key to happinessKey to happinessYou're dying insideLike a flower that's been kept in the darkEmpty is your soul Nothing's working to fill it up enoughThough fuck ups are aboundThere is still hope somehowSo let it surround you babySavor all the sweetnessLose all your bitternessYou'll find that's the key to happinessYeah yeahShake off some saltinessBear with the sournessThat's half of the key to happinessKey to happinessBut don't side step itThere's no detour round itBet you've been scratching your headBut why side step itWhen there's a road aheadThere's a big sign pointing to it
