It's not that, there is anything to denyIt's just that, pretending seems rightFunny how I've kept my smile outsideBut this empty yearning deep insideTo everyone I'm no more than prefectBut the fact that there's no harmonyAnd all these time I' dreading the momentThat I'll finally let you downMidnight is when loneliness creeps withthinAnd I've been wasting my time Gallivanting around towns all nightSick and tired of what's there in sightNot because I'm feeling blueFact is I am afraid thatYou'd see lies in my eyesAnd if one second given the choice to decideThen I'd rather let me downTo everyone I'm no more than prefectBut the fact is there's no harmonyAnd all these time I'm dreading the momentThat I'll finally let you downThat I'll finally let you down
