(speach)I remember quite clearly now when this story happenedThe autumn leaves were floating and measured down to the groundRecovering the lake where we used to swim like childrenOn the sun would dare to shineThat time we used to be happy But, I thought we were...But the truth was that - you had been longing to leave meNot daring to tell meOn that precious night watching the lake vaguely consciousYou said : our story was endingNow I'm standing here no one to wipe away my tearsNo one to keep me warm and no one to walk along withNo one to make me feel no one to make me hopeOh ! what am I to do ? I'm standing here alone it doesn't seem so clear to meWhat am I supposed to do about this burning heart of mineOn what am I to do,Or how should I react ? oh tell me please !(speach)The rain was killing the last days of summerYou had been killing my last breath of loveSince a long time ago..I still don't think I'm gonna make it through another love storyYou took it all away from meAnd there I stand , I knew I was gonna be the...The one left behindBut still I'm watching the lake vaguely consciousAnd I know - my life is ending
