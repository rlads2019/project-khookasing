ParadiseFeels like diamonds in disguiseDon't think twice think rightA perfect crimeYou stole my heart in record timeLeft behind no signSo play me like a string up on a violinI know it sounds so sad but it feels so goodGot me locked inside your love without tryin'Like ohhhSo take me to your heaven like I'm dyin'Cause I would leave this place only if you stoodRight beside me on the edge of the horizonLike ohhhSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me upHypnotizedFeels like crystals when I cryI don't mindDon't mindFantasizedAbout your body rising next to mineFeels so niceSo niceSo play me like a string up on a violinI know it sounds so sad but it feels so goodGot me locked inside your love without tryin'Like ohhh So take me to your heaven like I'm dyin'Cause I would leave this place only if you stoodRight beside me on the edge of the horizonLike ohhhSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me upPull me upPull me upPull me upPull me upSo pull me upHypnotizedSo pull me upFantasizedPull me upPull me upPull me upSo pull me upFeels so niceSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me upSo pull me upBaby when the sun goes downI'll be waiting for you on the GroundSo pull me up
