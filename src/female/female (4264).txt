再一次提起筆 再次想起你心裡的嘆息　變成雨黑夜靜默如迷繁星如夢 燈火如你好多事來不及好多人相遇分離好多話都藏在心裡好多年匆匆過去我和你就像手和手語就像倔強的風箏追著風去逆著光迎著雨世界寬廣遼闊借我小小角落借我　光和火借我一首歌問冰冷大河借浪花一朵借我溫暖的脈搏那怕荒涼沼澤借我雙手可以握任風雪心頭落借我小小屋簷可以躲看悲傷流成河夜空繁星朵朵哪一顆是我閃爍的螢火借我照亮我讓灰暗的有顏色讓冰冷的變溫熱等風雪吹過留我冰霜一朵讓我記得世界寒冷但你溫熱　如河 -----------------------------------------Like A RiverTake the pen againThink of you againSigh in my heartBacome rainDark night as a mysteryStars are like a dreamLights are like youA lot of things are too lateMany people meet and separateA lot of words are hidden in my heartHas been rushing for many yearsMe and youLike hands and sign languageLike a stubborn kiteChasing the windAgainst the light against the rainThe world is vastLend me a cornerLend me light and fireLend me a songAsk the cold river to borrow the sprayLend me a warm pulseEven the desolate marshLend me a hand to holdLet the snow fall on the heartLend me a small eaves to hideLook sad into a riverStarry night skyWhich one is my flashing fireflyLend me to illuminate meLet the darkness become colored Let the cold change warmWait until the snow blowsLeave me a frostLet me remember the cold of the worldBut you are warm like a river
