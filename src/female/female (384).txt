Words fall through meAnd always fool meAnd I can't reactAnd games that never amountTo more than they're meantWill play themselves outTake this sinking boat and point it homeWe've still got timeRaise your hopeful voice you have a choiceYou've made it now Falling slowly, eyes that know meAnd I can't go backMoods that take me and erase meAnd I'm painted blackYou have suffered enoughAnd warred with yourselfIt's time that you wonTake this sinking boat and point it homeWe've still got timeRaise your hopeful voice you had a choiceYou've made it nowFalling slowly sing your melodyI'll sing along
