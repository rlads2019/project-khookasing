On the quiet street in the cityA little old man walked aloneShuffing through the autumn afternoonAnd the autumn leaves reminded himAnother summer's come and goneHe had a long long midnight ahead waiting for JuneThe among the leaves near an orphan's homeA piece of paper caught his eyesAnd he stood to pick it up with trembling handsAnd as he read the childish writingThe old man began to cry'Cause the words burned inside him like a brand' 'Whoever finds this , I love youWhover finds this , I need youI even got no one to talk toSo , whoever finds this , I love you 'Well , the old man's eyes searched the orphan's home And came to rest upon a childWith her nose pressed up against the window paneAnd the old man knew he'd found a friend at lastSo he waved at her and smiledAnd they both knew they'd spend the winterLaughing at the rainAnd they did spend the winter laughing at the rain ,Talking through the fence ,Exchanging little gifts they've made for each other.The old man wold carve toys,And the little girl would draw pictures fo beautiful ladiesAnd they laughed a lot.But then one day, on the first of June,The lttle girl ran to the fence -- the old man wasn't there.And , somehow she knew he was never coming beck.So she went back to her lttle room , took a crayon 　 And wrote :' 'Whoever finds this , I love you 　 Whover finds this , I need youI even got no one to talk to 　 So , whoever finds this , I love you '
