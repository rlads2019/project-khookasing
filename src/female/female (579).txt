If My Loving YouCould Change The Rivers FolwI Would Not Let You Drift Away From MeI'd Never Let GoI Want To Be By Your SideBut The Water's Too Deep And WideIn Another LifeIn Another PlaceI'd Have Held You CloseI'd Have Known Your Face In Another WorldIn Another TimeYou'd Be MineYou'd Be MineIf I Touched You NowI'd Only Loose My MindOo... In The Cruel World I've Been GivenOne Life At A TimeI Don't Know Where Or WhenBut We'll Pass This Way Again
