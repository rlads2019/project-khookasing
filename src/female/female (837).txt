There's a moon over bourbon street tonightI see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamplightI've no choice but to follow that callThe bright lights, the people, and the moon and allI pray everyday to be strongFor I know what I do must be wrongOh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feetWhile there's a moon over bourbon streetIt was many years ago that I became what I amI was trapped in this life like an innocent lambNow I can never show my face at noonAnd you'll only see me walking by the light of the moonThe brim of my hat hides the eye of a beastI've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feetWhile there's a moon over bourbon streetShe walks everyday through the streets of New OrleansShe's innocent and young from a family of meansI have stood many times outside her window at nightTo struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlightHow could I be this way when I pray to god aboveI must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I loveOh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feetWhile there's a moon over bourbon street
