Oh baby baby I'm I'm loveBut not with you with someone elseYou're maybe maybe unconcernedCos' everything's bout you (everything is about you)Understand it's me not youIt's me who can't seem to be trueCan't go on, living in a lieYou didn't live up to expectations Since the day you've entered my houseShe become so old and wearyWrinkled all my sheets and my faceThere are just among the other thingOh enough enough of hanging aroundThere must be something else to doNo, this can't go on, this can't be allowedI'm not a slave to you condescensionDu du du......there are just among other things
