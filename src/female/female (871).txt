Be hold the way our fine feathered friendHis virtue doth paradeThou knowest not my dim witted friendThe picture Thou hast madeThy vacant brow and Thy tousled hairConceal Thy good intentThou noble upright, truthful, sincereAnd slightly dopey gentYou're my funny ValentineSweet comic ValentineYou make me smile with my heart Your looks are laughableUnphotographableYet you're my favorite work of artIs your figure less than GreekIs your mouth a little weakWhen you open it to speakAre you smart?But don't change a hair for meNot if you care for meStay little Valentine stayEach day is Valentine's day!
