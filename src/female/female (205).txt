I feel so bad I got a worried mindã€€I'm so lonesome all the timeSince I left my baby behind on blue bayouSaving nickels, Saving dimes working til the sun don't shineLooking forward To happier times on blue bayouI'm going back some day come What may to blue bayouWhere the folks are fine and world is Mine on blue bayouWhere those fishing boats with their sails Float lf I could only seeThat familiar sunrise through sleepy Eyes how happy I'll be gonna see my baby again gonna be With some of my friendsmaybe I'll feel better again on blue bayouSaving nickels, saving dimes working til the sun don't shineLooking forward to happier times on blue bayouoh, that boy Of mine by my side the silver moon and the evening tideOh, some sweet day going to take away this hurting insideWell, I'll never be blue my dreams come true on blue bayou
