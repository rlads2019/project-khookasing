Why don't you say that you love me?Why don't you say that you careI can be yoursYou can be mineWe can go to the heaven togetherWhy don't you say that you fear me?Why don't you say that you don't?I can be nice You can be cruelWe can play good from now till foreverWhy can't you say it? Why oh why?Why can't you love me? Why?What can't it be? Why oh why?What will it be? Why?Why oh why?
