Day after day I must face a world of strangersWhere I don't belong, I'm not that strongIt's nice to know that there's someone I can turn toWho will always care, you're always thereWhen there's no getting over that rainbowWhen my smallest of dreams won't come trueI can take all the madness the world has to giveBut I won't last a day without youSo many times when the city seems to be without a friendly faceA lonely placeIt's nice to know that you'll be there if I need youAnd you'll always smile, it's all worthwhileWhen there's no getting over that rainbowWhen my smallest of dreams won't come trueI can take all the madness the world has to giveBut I won't last a day without you Touch me and I end up singingTroubles seem to up and disappearYou touch me with the love you're bringingI can't really lose when you're nearIf all my friends have forgotten half their promisesThey're not unkind, just hard to findOne look at you and I know that I could learn to liveWithout the rest, I found the bestWhen there's no getting over that rainbowWhen my smallest of dreams won't come trueI can take all the madness the world has to giveBut I won't last a day without youWhen there's no getting over that rainbowWhen my smallest of dreams won't come trueI can take all the madness the world has to giveBut I won't last a day without you[中譯]日復一日，我必須面對一個全是陌生人的世界，我部屬於那個世界，我沒有那個堅強。知道有人可以讓我求助，這真是美好！那個人總是願意關懷，你總是在這裡。當場沒有跨越彩虹這種事，當我最渺小的夢想也不會實現時，這個世界所有的瘋狂我都可以承受，但是我不能沒有你。很多時候，這個城市似乎成為，一個沒有友善面孔的寂寞之境。知道當我需要你，你就會在我身邊，這真是美好，而你始終笑容滿面，一切都是那麼值得！感動我，我因而歡唱，煩惱似乎全都消失無蹤，你用你帶來的愛感動了我。當你就在身邊時，我不會迷失，當你在身邊，我的愛。假如我的朋友們都忘記了他們大多數的承諾，他們不是不和善，只是很難從中找到，一個看起來像你這樣的人。於是我明白，我必須學會遺世獨活，不去理會所有其他的人。因為我已經找到最好的了。
