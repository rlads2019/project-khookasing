Here come old flattop he come grooving up slowlyHe got joo-joo eyeball he one holy rollerHe got hair down to his kneeGot to be a joker he just do what he pleaseHe wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam footballHe got monkey finger he shoot coca-colaHe say 'I know you, you know me'One thing I can tell you is you got to be freeCome together right now over me He bag production he got walrus gumbootHe got Ono sideboard he one spinal crackerHe got feet down below his kneeHold you in his armchair you can feel his diseaseCome together right now over meHe roller-coaster he got early warningHe got muddy water he one mojo filterHe say 'One and one and one is three'Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to seeCome together right now over me
