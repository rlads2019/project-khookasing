You're my love, you're my angelYou're the girl of my dreamsI'd like to thank youFor waiting patientlyDaddy's homeYour daddy's home to stay*How I've waited for this momentTo be by your sideYour best friend wrote and told meYou had teardrop in your eyesDaddy's HomeYour daddy's home to stay It wasn't on a SundayMonday and Tuesday went byIt wasn't on a Tuesday afternoonAll I cxould do was cryBut I made promise that you treasureI've made it back home to youRepeat *)I'm not a thousand miles awayDaddy's homeAnd I'm gonna be hereCome wiht me all alone
