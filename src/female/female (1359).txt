This is not how I want you to see meI have done the best I canNow the only thing I believe inIs a women and a manCHORUSYou are the reason I stay in the fightWhen I can't take it anymoreYou are the reason I'll wake in the nightAnd say that I was only dreaming of it all(You are the reason I stay in the fight) And now in the dawnlight, he talks with me againRemember all the things we've doneBeen through the bad timesAnd we've seen through the sad timesWe're stronger than beforeAnd you picked me up when I was fallingAnd you gave me back my prideAnd you listen when I am callingAnd hear the me insideCHORUS
