It's a long long journeyTill I know where I'm supposed to beIt's a long long journeyAnd I don't know if I can believeWhen shadows fall and block my eyesI am lost and know that I must hideIt's a long long journeyTill I find my way home to youMany days I've spentDrifting on through empty shoresWondering what's my purposeWondering how to make me strongI know I will falter I know I will cryI know you'll be standing by my side It's a long long journeyAnd I need to be close to youSometimes it feels no one understandsI don't even know whyI do the things I doWhen pride builds me up till I can't see my soulWill you break down these walls and pull me through?Cause It's a long long journeyTill I feel that I am worth the priceYou paid for me on calvaryBeneath those stormy skiesWhen Satan mocks and friends turn to foesIt feel like everything is out to make me lose controlCause It's a long long journeyTill I find my way home to you. to you
