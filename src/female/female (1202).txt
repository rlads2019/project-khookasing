Today I'm closing up the housecause it don't feel like homeThe harder twilight pulls at methe less I wanna goThey say that all the streets of heavenare paved with goldThat's just to hurry up us folksthat get too oldTime gets me wound uplike a clock inside my headTime gets me sponning my own wheelsAnd when I think that there ain't one more inchthis worn out heart can giveTime's gonna teach me how it feelsWatch your hands they don't get caughtI'm bout to close this doorYou bright young kids are all I gotand now I know what forYou'll see that love's the only thingwe're got to showTime will just run out but love I knowTime gets you wound uplike a clock inside your head Time gets you spinning your own wheelsAnd while you're losing what you foundyou're finding out that's what you needTime's gonna teach you how it feelsI know your father's watchingHe's saving me a place right by his sideAnd that you don't like to hear that kind a talkBut it ain't up to me to hideDon't make it hard for me to goDon't make it hard for meThis house has seen some fifly yearsAtop the same old soilBut houses are just houses childIts people are what's loyalYou'll see that love's the only thingwe've got to showTime will just run out but love I knowTime gets you wound uplike a clock inside your headTime gets you sponning your own wheelsAnd when you think that there ain't one more inchyour worn out heart can giveTime's gonna teach you how it feels
