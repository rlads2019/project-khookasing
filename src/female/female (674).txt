All his friends would go to movies on Friday nightsThey'd be drinking beer and acting like clownsBut he would go to see a lady on the other side of townShe lived just a block away from Blue StreetNear the cemetery grounds 　 In a two story house by the riverOn the other side of town(chorus) 　 And the lady on the other side of townNever tried to make him cry or put him downAnd today he wished the lady could be foundOn the other side of townShe was 34 and he was 19 　 It was a social oddityBut nobody knew save the cat and the wind 　 That an older woman loved himThey'd play Joni Mitchell records for hours 　 Smoking cigarettes and watching TVOn a mattress on the floor by the windowWhere she made love to him(chorus) 　 ' I'll make you some tea,' the lady would say 　 ' If you would play piano for me 'And the lady missed her husbandShe talked of her divorce all the timeOh , she missed her lover 　 And her was missing his Cause his lover was an actressShe made him promises and let him downSo he had to find his love from a lady 　 On the other side of town(chorus) 　 The cold icy beam of the moonlightCast its shadows on their bodies that dancedAnd he noticed that the lady had fallen asleepSo he slipped on his pantsAnd he wrote her a note on hte tableThen he put the pencil downSaid that he was gonna leave the ladyOn the other side of town(chorus) 　 As he closed the gate behind himThe tears welled up in her eyesWith the note in her hand at the windowShe was sadly waving good - byeWell he never knew how much that he loved herAnd the thought never did occurThe someday he'd be somewhere far awayAnd still be thinking of her ( X2 )
