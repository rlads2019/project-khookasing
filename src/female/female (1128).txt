Will you remember the summerYou left then came backDisappearing through and endlessdiamond shimmering skyLike a shooting star splitted the nightI'm flying to be free passed the cloudstill the rainbow's endSearching for you and trace above the haloof the street lampsTears in my eyesDo not cryYou lay a whisper in my dreamI see an angel when you smile Will you remember the summerYou left then came backDisappearing through and endlessdiamond shimmering skyLike a shooting star splitted the nightI'm flying to be free passed the cloudstill the rainbow's endSearching for you and trace above the haloof the street lampsTears in my eyesDo not cryYou lay a whisper in my dreamI see an angel when you smileYou lay a whisper in my dreamI see an angel when you smile
