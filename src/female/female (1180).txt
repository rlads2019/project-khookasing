The whispers in the morningof lovers sleeping tightAre rolling like thunder nowAs I look in your eyesI hold on to your bodyAnd feel each move you makeYour voice is warm and tenderA love that I could not forsake'Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'll do all that I canLost is how I'm feeling lying in your armsWhen the world outside's too much to takeThat all ends when I'm with you Even though there may be timesIt seems I'm far awayNever wonder where I am'Cause I am always by your side'Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'll do all that I canWe're heading for somethingSomewhere I've never beenSometimes I am frightenedBut I'm ready to learnOf the power of loveThe sound of your heart beatingMade it clear suddenlyThe feeling that I can't go onIs light years away
