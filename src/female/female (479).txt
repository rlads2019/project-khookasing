He's so beautful to me 　 And in my wildest dreamsDid I ever dream he would come to meNow I was lost but I have foundTrue heaven through his loveAnd comfort knowing he's so beautiful to meHe's the key to the door 　 Of joy never endingHe's the light , he's the way 　 And without him I sayI can't go onAnd I will love him till I dieAnd even then I know This love will grow and grow 　 He's so beautful to meFor he , he's beautiful to me 　 He gives me so much loveWithout thinking of what he gets from meHe's the road with no end 　 He's the life everlastingHe's a friend , he's a kingAnd to him I will bring all I haveAnd I will love him till I die 　 And even then I knowThis love will grow and growHe's beautiful to me 　 He's beautiful to meSo beautiful to me
