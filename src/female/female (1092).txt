風吹幾多春秋　堆積幾多砂丘吹拂幾多當初最熱熾雙手心中幾多爭鬥　抑鬱幾多傷口終於一天都需要有個出口一刻湧於心頭　很想抽身出走誰人能明白透Sometimes I cry, somewhere inside纏結是這麼多　怎麼可拆解But someday I'll fly, I don't wanna hide如怯懦這苦楚　跌墮If someone's by my side, it's alrightI can fly孤單幾多深秋　掩飾幾多傷憂當初幾多希冀最尾也失守真的不想深究　十二萬樣因由可否等到一天某某會拯救很想拋開所有　很想抽身出走 誰人能明白透Sometimes I cry, somewhere inside纏結是這麼多　怎麼可拆解But someday I'll fly, I don't wanna hide如怯懦這苦楚　跌墮If someone's by my side, it's alrightI can fly太幸運到最尾　遇見了你往昔的痛悲　已找到曙曦以後這算洩氣　我也有你捉緊你折翼能飛這刻即使漂流　不需孤身出走有你全然望透Sometimes I cry, somewhere inside纏結或許很多　都總可拆解Someday I'll fly, I don't need to hide如怯懦這苦楚　跌墮With you by my side, it's alrightI can fly
