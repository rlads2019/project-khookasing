Ain't that justThe story of my lifeAfter it's too late I find the keyAin't that justThe story of my lifeI pray it's not too late for you and meI knowIt will all work outSomedayLord knows whenSomehowI will fight the doubtSheer willKeeps me sane 'til thenWhen I look at the horizon I can see you bright and clearMy mistakes are all behind meA new chapters drawing nearAnd I may have missed the boatBut I can meet you at the pierAin't that justThe story of my lifeStill no one knows what we're heading toAnd I trustThe story of my lifeWill have a happy end when I'm with youThis doesn't have to end up as a tragedyOr need to be a melancholy taleAnd though I never seem to choose the easy pathI try and failBut we'll prevailAin't that justThe story of my lifeIt will all be worth what I've been throughFor I trustThe story of my lifeWill reach a happy end when I'm with youNight fallsAnd you're in my dreamsIt's the story of my life
