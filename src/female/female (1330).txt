Come milenio let there be doors to beautyCome milenio let there be cure for spiteNo more disguise , simplicity thrivesBe weightless so we can flyRight under the stars , a voice from afarA key I have placed in your heartCome milenio , the answer lies in the questionCome milenio m beyond the despair there is hopeThe desert may bloom , bewilder the foolSo much is left unreveakedYou haven't a clue , a womb or a tomb Look into a flower you'll see fruitCome milenio , may fire make peace with waterCome milenio , a fist ends with open handRemember the flames , forget not the painsLest we make the same mistakeSurrender the grudge , embrace the unlovedThe curses no longer beheldCome milenio , may tears shed not out of sorrowCome milenio , mat we cherish what we'veBorrowed
