You're perfect and you're not far from the truthYou read your lines so smoothlyI like your blue eyesI like the way you moveSo take the lead role make me feel so I would't know how I'd do without youI can't believe that you're ready to settleJust like the movies I'm gonna get what I deserveLa la la la.....I want a love storyLa la la la.....Like in the moviesLa la la la.....I want a love storyLike in the movies
