WindflowersMy father told me not to go near themHe feared them alwaysSaid they carried him awayWindflowersI couldn't wait to touch them to smeel themI held them closelyNow I cannot break away Their sweet balminess disappearsLike the vapor in the desertTake a warning, sonWindflowersTheir beauty captures everyYoung dreamer who lingers near themAncient windflower, I love you
