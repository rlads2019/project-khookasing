You with the sad eyesDon't be discouragedOh I realizeIt's hard to take courageIn a world full of peopleYou can lose sight of it allAnd the darkness inside youCan make you feel so smallBut I see your true colorsShining throughI see your true colorsAnd that's why I love youSo don't be afraid to let them showYour true colorsTrue colors are beautifulLike a rainbow Show me a smile thenDon't be unhappy can't rememberWhen I last saw you laughingIf this world makes you crazyAnd you've taken all you can bearYou call me upBecause you know I'll be thereAnd I'll see your true colorsShining throughI see your true colorsAnd that's why I love youSo don't be afraid to let them showYour true colorsTrue colors are beautifulLike a rainbow
