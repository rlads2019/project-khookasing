If you close the doorthe night could last foreverLeave the sunshine outand say hello to neverAll the people are dancingand they're having such funI wish it could happen to meBut if you close the doorI'd never have to see the day againIf you close the doorthe night could last foreverLeave the wine-glass outand drink a toast to neverOh, someday I knowsomeone will look into my eyesAnd say helloyou're my very special one But if you close the doorI'd never have to see the day againDark party bars, shiny Cadillac carsand the people on subways and trainsLooking gray in the rainas they stand disarrayedoh, but people look well in the darkAnd if you close the doorthe night could last foreverLeave the sunshine outand say hello to neverAll the people are dancingand they're having such funI wish it could happen to meCause if you close the doorI'd never have to see the day againI'd never have to see the day again, once moreI'd never have to see the day again
