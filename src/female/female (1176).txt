Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensationDarkness stirs and wakes imaginationSilently the senses abandon their defensesSlowly, gently, night unfurls its splendourGrasp it, sense it, tremulous and tenderTurn your face away from the garish light of dayTurn your face away from cold, unfeeling lightAnd listen to the music of the nightClose you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreamsLeave all thoughts of the world you knew beforeClose your eyes let your spirit start to soarAnd you'll live as you've never lived beforeSoftly, deftly, music shall caress youHear it, feel it, secretly possess you Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwindIn this darkness which you know you cannot fightThe darkness of the music of the nightLet your mind start a journey through a strange, new worldLeave all thoughts of the world you knew beforeLet your soul take you where you long to goOnly then can you belong to meFloating, falling, sweet intoxicationTouch me, trust me, savour each sensationLet the dream begin, let your darker side give inTo the harmony which dreams alone can writeThe power of the music of the nightYou alone can make my song take flightHelp me make the music of the night
