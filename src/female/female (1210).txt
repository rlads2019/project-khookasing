Close my eyes and feel your mindTime has passedI walked like a shadowNever knewWhat I am going throughYou touch my heart and take my breath awayWhisper on the wind so softlyLet the bright stars fill our dreams with loveReach for your hand (your hold is my key)and you show me the wayTonight, I feel close to youYou open my door and light the sky aboveWhen I need a friend, you are there right by my sideI wish we could stay as one(I wish we could stay forever as one)All the tears that haunt my pastYou promisedIt'll be better tomorrowplay that songYou and I listened toAnd let it gently ease our painTender rain drops from the blue skyFlowers blooming, life is so divine like sunlight on a stream (you're holding my key)You show the world to meTonight, I feel close to youYou open my door and light the sky aboveWhen I need a friend, you are there right by my sideI wish we could stay as oneSo much love in this beautiful worldSearch for the brightest star in the skyYou will find the meaning of loveDon't be afraid (Don't be afraid)Just be yourself (Just be yourself)We need this love... I've never knewTonight, I feel close to youYou open my door and light the sky aboveWhen I need a friend, you are there right by my sideI wish we could stay as oneTonight, I feel close to youYou open my door and light the sky aboveWhen I need a friend, you are there right by my sideI wish we could stay as oneI wish we could stay forever as one
