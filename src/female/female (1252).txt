Are you walking through an empty roomWith a picture in your handsHow could anyone just leave you hereAlone in no - man's landAfter all the color of the nightJust to know the shade of blueAnd the silent cage can barely hideA new day shinin' throughAnd we'll all be waiting for the morningWe'll be one step further from the startThere's a new day waiting in the winds againAnd a chance to play a better part Then we'll all be waiting for the morningYou'd be one step closer to your heartWould it be so hard to start againIf our love should disappearI believe the force that leads you onIs stronger than your fearsAnd we'll all be waiting for the morningWe'll be one step further from the startThere's a new day waiting in the winds againAnd a chance to play a better partThe we'll all be waiting for the morningYou'd be one step closer to your heart
