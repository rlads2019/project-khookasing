I saw a picture of a small girlCrying and living in a lost worldThe men fight for dear GodShe don't careCause there ain't nothing left to shareI'd watched T.V. about a sick girlShe was only nine but she'll gone soonwhen and where she's going God will knowShe doesn't want the sun to goDon't you know that we care Keep the faith and hope is hereDeep in my heart I ask myselfDo we really really care？I read the paper of a colored boyHe was starving so we're the lone vulturesWhy so full of sorrow no tomorrowThere's no rainbow will he ever know？Don't you know that we prayfor you to see the light of dayFor you to bring back the look of lovewords of wisdom is not enough
