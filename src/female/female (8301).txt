Mama lift me up to heaven's gate tonightCause tonight is the nightMama am I just a blindspot in god's eyesReflection in the lightIf what the dead voice says is trueBehind the blue WhoShould I open the secret doorEnd allEnd moreMama take me to the edge of all my sinsSee a guilty king,see a falling kingMama see what you gave me,what kind of skinSkin I'm living in,things I'm suffering
