Come with me, in the silence of darknessI want to show you secrets of lifeI will guide you where dream couldn't take youShe seldom flew away in the nightYou're the moonlight flowerYou're the voice of the nightWhen you call I'll followWe will leave on a trip of delightI have been to the heights of my sensesFeeling the touch of your caresI have seen magic things of the night skiesUntil the sun rises underneath the skies
