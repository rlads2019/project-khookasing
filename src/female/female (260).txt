Why do birds suddenly appearEvery time you are nearJust like me, they long to beClose to youWhy do stars fall down from the skyEvery time you walk byJust like me, they long to beClose to youOn the day that you were bornThe angels got togetherAnd decided to create a dream come trueSo they sprinkled moon dustIn your hair of goldAnd starlight in your eyes of blueThat is why all the girls in townFollow you all aroundJust like me, they long to beClose to youJust like me, they long to beClose to youClose to you Close to youClose to youClose to youWhy do birds suddenly appearEvery time you are nearJust like me, they long to beClose to youWhy do stars fall down from the skyEvery time you walk byJust like me, they long to beClose to youOn the day that you were bornThe angels got togetherAnd decided to create a dream come trueSo they sprinkled moon dustIn your hair of goldAnd starlight in your eyes of blueThat is why all the girls in townFollow you all aroundJust like me, they long to beClose to you
