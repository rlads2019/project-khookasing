When I was youngI never needed anyoneAnd makin' love was just for funThose days are goneLivin' aloneI think of all the friends I've knownBut when I dial the telephoneNobody's homeAll by myselfDon't wanna beAll by myself anymoreAll by myself Don't wanna liveAll by myself anymoreHard to be sureSome times I feel so insecureAnd love so distant and obscureRemains the cureAll by myselfDon't wanna beAll by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna liveAll by myself anymore
