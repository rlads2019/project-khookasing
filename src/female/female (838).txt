Moon river, wider than a mileI'm crossing you in style some dayOh, dream maker, you heart breakerWherever you're goin', I'm goin' your wayTwo drifters, off to see the world There's such a lot of world to seeWe're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bendMy huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me(重複一次)
