Yesterday when I was youngThe taste of life was sweet like rain upon my tongueI teased at life as if it were a foolish gameThe way an evening breeze would tease a candle flameThe thousand dreams I dreamedThe splendid things I plannedI always built to last on weekend shifting sandI lived by night and shinned the naked light of dayAnd only now I see how the years have run awayYesterday when I was youngThere were so many songs that waited to be sungSo many wild pleasures lay in store for meAnd so musch pain my dazzled eyes refused to seeI ran so fast in time and youth at last ran out I never stopped to think what life was all aboutAnd every conversation that I can (now) recallConcerned itself with me and nothing else at allYesterday the moon was blueAnd every craze day brought something new to doAnd I used my mageic age as if it were a wandAnd ever saw all the waste and emptiness beyondThe game of love I played with arrogance and prideAnd every flame I lit so quickly , quickly diedThe friends I made off seem somehow to drife awayAnd only I'm left on stage to end the play ã€€ (chorus)There are so many song in me that won't be sung'Cause I feel the vitter taste of tears upon my tongueAnd the time has come for meTo pay for yesterday when I was young
