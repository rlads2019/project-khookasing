Bonfires dot the rolling hillsidesFigures dance around and aroundTo drums that pulse out echoes of darknessMovies to the pagan soundSomewhere in a hidden memoryImages float before my eyesOf fragrant nights of straw and of bonfiresAnd dancing till the next sunriseCHORUSI can see the lights in a distanceTrembling in the dark cloak of nightCandles and lanterns are dancing, dancingA walts on All Souls Night Figures of cornstalks bend in the shadowsHeld up tall as the flames leap highThe green knight holds the holly bushTo mark where the old year passes byCHORUSBonfires dot the rolling hillsidesFigures dance around and aroundTo drums that pulse out echoes of darknessAnd moving toward the pagan soundStanding on the bridge that crossesThe river that goes out to the seaThe wind is full of a thousand voicesThey pass by the bridge and me
