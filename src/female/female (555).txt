I remember noticing you firstNo one knew that I was looking at youKept a disguise for fear insideYou didn't feel it toCouldn't tell you what it was you didYour presense made a standing still in timeTaken by your stare I said a prayerSomeday you'll be mineWell someone was watching someone was listeningSomeone answered meNow that I found you I can't live without youBaby Oh baby I'm always dreaming of youYou're on my mind everwhere I goAnd baby don't you knowJust what my world's been going throughI try to stop my thoughts But that would be a lieAnd I can't deny it's trueI'm always dreaming of youNothing seems to matter anymoreEveryone I meet is not you (no one compares to you)Life's not the sameI don't complain Now that love feels true
