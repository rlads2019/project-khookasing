It came upon the midnight clear,That glorious song of old,From angels bending near the earth,To touch their harps of gold;“Peace on the earth, good will to men,From Heaven's all gracious King.”The world in solemn stillness lay,To hear the angels sing.當年夜半，天際傳來榮耀遠古歌聲。天使屈膝臨近塵寰，歡然手撥金琴。「地上平安人類蒙恩，來自榮耀君王，」當夜大地肅然靜候，齊聽天使歌聲。 Still through the cloven skies they comeWith peaceful wings unfurled,And still their heavenly music floatsO'er all the weary world;Above its sad and lowly plains,They bend on hovering wing,And ever over its Babel soundsThe bless%E8d angels sing.如今天使依舊來臨，展開和平翅膀，天歌妙音輕輕傳來，安慰疲乏世人，天軍歡然展開雙翼，俯視愁苦群生，萬邦擾嚷喧鬧聲中，仍聽天使歌聲。
