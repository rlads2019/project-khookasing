The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tightAre rolling like thunder now As I look in your eyesI hold on to your body And feel each move you makeYour voice is warm and tender A love that I could not forsake'Cause I am your lady And you are my manWhenever you reach for me I'll do all that I canLost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms When the world outsides's too much to takeThat all ends when I'm with you Even though there may be timesIt seems I'm far away Never wonder where I am'Cause I am always by your sideWe're heading for something Somewhere I've never beenSometimes I am frightened But I'm ready to learn of the power of loveThe sound of your heart beating Made it clearSuddenly the feeling that I can't go on Is light years away
