I'm standing in the stationI'm waiting for a trainto take me to the borderand my loved one far awayI watched a bunch of soldirs heading for the warI could hardly even bear to see them goRolling through the countrysideTears are in my eyesWe're coming to the borderlineI'm ready with my liesAnd in the early morning rain i see him thereAnd I know I'll have to say goodbye againAnd it's breaking my heartI know what I must doI hear my country call meBut I want to be with youI'm taking my sideOne of us will loseDon't let go, I want to know That you will wait for me until the dayThere's no borderline, no borderlineWalking past the border guardsreaching for his handShowing no emotionI want to break into a runBut these are only boysand I will never knowHow men can see the wisdom in a warAnd it's breaking my heartI know what I must doI hear my country call meBut I want to be with youI'm taking my sideOne of us will loseDon't let go, I want to knowThat you will wait for me until the dayThere's no borderline, no borderlineno borderline, no borderline...
