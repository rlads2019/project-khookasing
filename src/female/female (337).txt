Long long time ago you made itSeem like we were impossibleSo I wrote you off (bad history)(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close* Now that I'm way ahead from where I've left behindWho are you then to call me and ask if I'm alright?Now that I'm bright and beautiful you're fat and oldTo think I've shed my pride for you down on my knees Tried hard to convince myself (it's not me)Who's not good enough for youBring bring me a javelin quick !(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close(repeat *)Vanish now before I cryDiminish or else I mightHow how very unneccessaryTo see you walking down my hallI was hit by the shame in me(Don't you dare) don't you dare get too close
