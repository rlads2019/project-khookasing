And then with a gust of wind things changedSet off on a course that seemed to me quites strangeI was heading through the air straight for the moonStraight for the moonAnd when I landed he took my handWe dinned and we danced with the starsHe asked me to stay in this DreamlandBut the wind called out so I went insteadThen he turned to me and saidDon't sail away　Don't sail away from meDon't sail away　We could have such a lovely timeDon't sail away　Don't sail away from meDon't sail away　You could stay and just be mineI told him not this time The wind carried me across deep spacesI visted many times and many placesI drifted till my boat came to a stop Destiny's roof topInside I played chess with DestinyI saw a way to win so very easilyBut he was taking far too long to make his moveDestiny wouldn't moveSo I turned my boat back towards that DreamlandAnd I filled the sails with my breathWhen I landed he took my handThought the wind called out I remained insteadHe still turned to me and saidDon't sail away　Don't sail away from meDon't sail away　We could have such a lovely timeDon't sail away　Don't sail away from meDon't sail away　You could stay and just be mineI like to stay for lifetime
