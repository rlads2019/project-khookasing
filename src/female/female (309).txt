Well , I'll be damned , here comes your ghose againBut that's not unusual , it's just that the moon is fullAnd you happened to callAnd here I sit , hand on the telephoneHearing a voice I'd known , a couple of light years agoHearing straight for a fallAs I remember your eyes were bluer than robin's eggsMy poetry was lousy you said　 where are you calling from ?A booth in the midwestTen years ago I bought you some cufflinksYou brought my something　 we both know what memories can bringThey bring diamonds and rustWell you burst on the scene already a legendThe unwatched phenomenon , the original vagabondYou strayed into my arms And there you stayed , temporaroly lost at seaThe madona was yours for freeYes the girl onthe half shell could keep you unharmedNow I see you standing with brown leaves fallingAll around and snow in your hairNow you're smiling out the window ofThat crummy hotel over washigton squaareOur breath comes out white clouds mingles & hangs in the airSpeaking strickly for me , we both could've died then and thereNow you're telling my you're not nostalgicThen give me another word for itYou who're so good with words and at keeping things vagueCause I need some of that vagueness nowIt's all come back to clearlyYes I lovesd you dearlyAnd if you're offering my diamonds and rust　 I've already paid
