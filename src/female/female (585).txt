作詞：王曉倩作曲：楊秉音When awakeI see the light and dark have changedDays and daysPeople whisper and prayWild visions touch your dreamThose memories will fade awayDon't be sadGlimmers still remainThere's a chanceYou are gonna touch the soulDays and moonsSearching for a land of hopeSufferings 'll be painlessAll miseries will never comeDon't be afraidEverything's the sameAhhhhhAhhhhhWhen the glory days are goneOnly one truth can be trusted It's time to partThere's a chanceYou are gonna touch the soulDays and moonsSearching for a land of hopeSufferings 'll be painlessAll miseries will never comeDon't be afraidEverything's the sameAhhhhhAhhhhhWhen the glory days are goneOnly one truth can be trustedIt's time to partAhhhhhAhhhhhTurning whole world upside downCouldn't make me feel aliveDon't leave meFlee with meOnly you can break my fallWhen awakeI see the light and dark have changed
