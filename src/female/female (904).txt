Love dreams and illusionsI see in your eyesLosing myself in your liesI'm alone walking back home on my ownLost and cold,Can't find you anymoreThears flowed they've gone cold Crying in my sorrowAnd no matter how I try and I try toRemember where you used to beI search my heart and I find there's no one thereWoh midnight I feel like I've died in my sleepAt light everything slie is mimi to meLooking back on those wonderful momentsI had never dreamed this would beNow all that's left is a broken heart with meNo one has ever been a dreamer for meI've been a fool for loving you endlessly
