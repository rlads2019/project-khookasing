Happiness hit her like a train on a trackComing towards her stuck still no turning backShe hid it 'round corners and she hid it under bedsShe killed it with kisses and from it she fledWith every bubble she sank with her drinkAnd washed it away down the kitchen sinkThe dog days are over The dog days are doneThe horses are coming So you better runRun fast for your mother, run fast for your fatherRun for your children, for your sisters and brothersLeave all your love and your longing behindYou can't carry it with you if you want to surviveThe dog days are over The dog days are doneCan you hear the horses? 'Cause here they come And I never wanted anything from youExcept everything you had and what was left after that too, ohHappiness hit her like a bullet in the backStruck from a great height by someonewho should know better than thatThe dog days are over The dog days are doneCan you hear the horses? 'Cause here they comeRun fast for your mother, run fast for your fatherRun for your children, for your sisters and brothersLeave all your love and your longing behindYou can't carry it with you if you want to surviveThe dog days are over The dog days are doneCan you hear the horses? 'Cause here they comeHere they come
