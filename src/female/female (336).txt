Talk to me love, if I tell you I'm in love with youWould it be, enough?No matter what I say or doI loved you once, where did you go?Wasn't enough, so you left me?You let go no, here I thought your love was so realStop playing around, I know you're still thereBelieved you'd come back, so I stayed right hereI know I still need you, No matter what I do,Holding back tears, till the day I, see youNo I don't wanna cryWon't accept your goodbyeThough the tears fill my eyes,Still I don't wanna cryUnsure of where to go, in streets I used to know,There's nothing left of me, a shell without a soul Sometimes I wonder if, you're looking for me just as muchas I lose my mind, looking for you boyStop playing around, I know you're still thereBelieved you'd come back, still waiting right hereI know I still need you, oh what do I do?Holding back tears, but now I'm drowningNo I Don't wanna cryWon't accept your goodbyeThough the tears fill my eyesStill I don't wanna cryI'm alright (I'm not alright)I wanna be alone tonight (I miss you so)I smile all the pain awayBut I'm lying to myself, there's no one elseI want to forget butMy heart just has a mind of its ownSo Come back, just come back, please come backWithout the other half here, how do I live as one?
