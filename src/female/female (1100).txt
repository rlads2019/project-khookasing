See how the night has fallenFallen upon you and meSee how its cloak has covered usGuarding our mysteriesAnd how the stars are sinkingSinking below you and meLost in a dream of oblivionLost in the shimmering sea As the wind flies over the world unseenLilac eyes shine in the darkAnd with the rise and fall of our unspoken dreamsShe gathers us into her arms withSongs and silhouettesSongs you won't forgetFeel how the world is floatingFloating around you and meFeel how the air is whisperingSecrets of eternity
