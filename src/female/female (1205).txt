I can see your face everywhere I lookBut everywhere is nowhere without you'What seemed to be like daysWas just a moment in timeBut it meant the world to meCuz I knewWhat I've been searching for all of my lifeI had it right here - in front of my eyesAnd what I've wished for was nothing comparedTo what I received - when you were here with me＊And if you'll never come back　And today was all that we had　And if I won't see - tomorrow with you in my arms　It won't matter because　Now I know what it's like to be lovedYou're so far away but I feel you so nearIt's like you never left me - Never said good byeI can hear your voice in the crowd I can feel you touch me right nowI can see you smile when I close my eyesAnd I hold on to that every nightTo help me understand - When I ask myself whyOf all the people out there - You chose to be with meTo share a love so rareRepeat ＊What a beautiful thing - To feel your love withinLike a child that sees the sunshine on the first day of springJust to know it's true - There is someone like youWho can make me believe there is nothing I can't doif you'll never come backAnd today was all that we hadAnd if I won't see - tomorrow with you in my armsIt won't matter becauseNow I know what it's like to be lovedto be loved
