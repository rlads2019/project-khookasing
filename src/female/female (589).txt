Strangely I have found myself a friend insdeA friend too kind, how I'm awareThat everything's turning inside outThe wall around me keeps on fallingDespite of it all, I don't whySuddenly it all came to meThat it could've been the fact I wanna break freeFunny how, I used to be so scaredOh how I've changed my mindNow that everything's turning inside outI'm tired of this city lifeInstead of going right I'll take a left this timeOh I'll even try to beat the lights
