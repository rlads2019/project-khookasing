A fine romance with no kissesA fine romance, my friend, this isWe should be like a couple of hot tomatoesBut you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoesA fine romance, you won't nestleA fine romance, you won't wrestleI might as well play bridge with my old maid auntI haven't got a chanceThis is a fine romanceA fine romance, my good fellowYou take romance, I'll take jelloYou're calmer than the seals in the Arctic OceanAt least they flap their fins to express emotionA fine romance with no quarrelsWith no insults and all moralsI've never mussed the crease in your blue serge pantsI never get the chanceThis is a fine romance A fine romance with no kissesA fine romance, my friend, this isWe two should be like clams in a dish of chowderBut we just fizz like parts of a Seidlitz powderA fine romance, with no glitchesA fine romance, with no bitchesYou're just as hard to land as the 'Isle de France'I haven't got a chanceThis is a fine romanceVocal: Karen MokPiano: Bugge WesseltoftGuitars: Lawrence KuBass: Eun-Chang ChoiPercussion: Arai SoichiroDrums: Yong Heng WuViolin Solo: Peng Fei
