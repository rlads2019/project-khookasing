I believe the children are our futureTeach them well and let them lead the wayShow them all the beauty they possess insideGive them a sense of prideTo make it easierLet the children's laughter remind us how we used to beEverybody's searching for a heroPeople need someone to look up toI never found anyone to fulfill my needsA lonely place to beAnd so I learned to depend on meI decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadowIf I fail, if I succeed, at least I live as I believeNo matter what they take from meThey can't take away my dignityChorus:Because of greatest love of all is happening to meI found the greatest love of all inside of meThe greatest love of all is easy to achieve Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of allI believe the children are our futureTeach them well and let them lead the wayShow them all the beauty they possess insideGive them a sense of prideTo make it easierLet the children's laughter remind us how we used to beI decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadowIf I fail, if I succeed, at least I live as I believeNo matter what they take from meThey can't take away my dignityChorusAnd if by chance that special placethat you've been dreaming ofLeads you to a lonely placeFind your strength in love
