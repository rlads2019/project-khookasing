In your heartIn your eyes In your mindAnd in your lifeThat's where I know I wanna beThat's where I know that I belongIf I were blindfolded I'd still know where to go I know I love youYou adore meThink our love is heaven sentBut the world's seen so cruel thatWe don't know what's gonna lastI know I love youYou adore meBut would our love find the strength?I can't help but to wonder where do we go from here
