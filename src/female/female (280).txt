You saw me crying in the chapel.The tears I shed were tears of joyI know the meaning of contentmentNow I am happy with the LordJust a plain and simple chapelWhere humble people go to prayI pray the Lord that I'll grow strongerAs I live from day to dayI've searched and I've searchedBut I couldn't findNo way on earthTo gain peace of mindNow I'm happy in the chapelWhere people are of one accordWe gather in the chapelJust to sing and praise the Lord Ev'ry sinner looks for somethingThat will put his heart at easeThere is only one true answerHe must get down on his kneesMeet your neighbor in the chapelJoin with him in tears of joyYou'll know the meaning of contentmentThen you'll be happy with the LordYou'll search and you'll searchBut you'll never findNo way on earthTo gain peace of mindTake your troubles to the chapelGet down on your knees and prayYour burdens will be lighterAnd you'll surely find the way
