You told me I was the one that you neededAnd that I was the girl of your dreamsEvery word that you said I believed inNow I am standing here with nothing at allYou made me see far beyond up the rainbowYou made my soul want to reach for the starsEvery word that you said I believed inNow I am standing here with nothing at allNothing at allBreaking the promiseThat I didn't know how you'd keptCause every time I got strongerYou wanted me to be weakSo you gave me everything just to take it againI thought I was more than your friendYou told me that I was the one that you neededAnd that I was the girl of your dreamsEvery word that you said I believed in Now I am standing here with nothing at allYou made me see far beyond up the rainbowYou made my soul want to reach for the starsEvery word that you said I believed inNow I am standing here with nothing at allNothing at allYou told me I was the one that you neededEvery word that you said, oh, I believed inso why u wanna do me like that, boyAnd leave me all aloneWithout a sound, without a clueTired of thinking of youâ€¦You told me I was the one that you neededAnd that I was the girl of your dreamsEvery word that you said I believed inNow I am standing here with nothing at allYou made me see far beyond up the rainbowYou made my soul want to reach for the starsEvery word that you said I believed inNow I am standing here with nothing at allYes I am standing here with nothing at all
