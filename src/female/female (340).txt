I saw her mother this morningAt the downtown cafeStaring blanklyDown in mourningHad her cup of gourmet coffeeAnd she asked meWhat her baby'd been missingAnd I shake my headCan't think of nothingBut candy wrappersTucked into the folds of the bedAnd how I don't see them aroundSince Sarah left townNow people always think they know youAnd they're almost always wrongTried to bend you till they broke youSo she moved alongAnd sometimes I see them aroundSince Sarah left townTrying to track her downSarah, Sarah Sarah, SarahShe's chasing her soulNot running awayIf you'd just let her goShe'll know the wayAnd I saw her mother this morningShe looked me in the eyeShe said: “you know sometimes,                 I think I hear her laughing        And all I can do is cry”And it's a funny thing about peopleHow everyone has a songAnd he sings it every momentBut we don't hear it until he's goneAnd sometimes I see them aroundSince Sarah left townThey're humming with heads hanging downSarah, SarahSarah, Sarah
