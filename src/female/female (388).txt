Back to the night in which I weptDid you think I was mad, sure I tried.You asked for someone you could hateDid you think that I cared, be it yes.I fear you like you fear meI fear you but you love meBack to the night when I was madeDid you think I'd forgive who I am？You asked for someone you could touch You knew I'd consider, who are youWould you mind, if I crumble？If you die, would I？Asking you to stay But I wanted moreAsking you to leave Still you needed me(You said you needed me)Asking you to stay Could I have some more？Asking you to leave Asking you to stay
