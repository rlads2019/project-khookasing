She's faced the hardest times you could imagineAnd many times her eyes fought back the tearsAnd when her youthful world was about to fall inEach time her slonder shouldersbore the weight of all her fearsAnd a sorrow no one hears till rings in mid-night silence in her earsLet her cry for she's a ladyLet her dream for she's a child*　Let the rain fall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild *Repeat *
