You're goneI can't believe itI can't believe itYou're everything to meI still feel youI still feel youAfter all this time even if I had foreverI never get over you'Cause I still feel you by my sideAnd after all we've been throughstill I never could say goodbyeI've tried a thousand timesbut I can't walk awayI'll never let goI'll never forget youIt's so hard to breatheit's hard to breatheRemember when the way it feltwhen you held mewhen you held meAfter all this time everyday just takes foreverI'll never get over you'Cause I still feel you by my sideAnd after all we've been throughstill I never could say goodbyeI've tried a thousand times but I can't walk awayI'll never let goI'll never forget youEvery moment you're gonefeels like a million yearsthe memories won't fade away noI'm missing everything about youI can't escape this feelingmy love won't change'Cause I still feel you by my sideAnd after all we've been throughstill I never could say goodbyeI've tried a thousand timesbut I can't walk awayI'll never let goI'll never forget you'Cause I still feel you by my sideAnd after all we've been throughstill I never could say goodbyeI've tried a thousand timesbut I can't walk awayI'll never let goI'll never forget youYou're goneI can't believe itI can't believe it
