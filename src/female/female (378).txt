Whenever sang my songson the stage　on my ownWhenever said my wordsWishing they would be heardI saw you smiling at meWas it real or just my fantasyYou'd always be there in the corner of this tiny little barMy last night here for yousame old songs　just once moreMy last night here with youMaybe Yes　Maybe NoI kind of liked it your wayHow you shyly placed your eyes on meDid you ever know that I had mine on you？Darling So there you arewith that look on your face As if you've never hurtAs if you've never downShall I be the one for youWho pinches you softly but sureIf frown is shown thenI will know that you are no dreamerSo let me come to youClose as I wanted to beClose enough for me to feel your heart beating fastand stay there as I whisperHow I loved your peaceful eyes on meDid you ever know that I had mine on you？Darling　So share with meyour love if you have enoughyour tears if you're holding backof pain If that's what it isHow can I let you knowI'm more than the dress and the voiceJust reach me out then you will know that you're not dreaming
