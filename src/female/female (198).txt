And it's a big dreamBig enough to shareLike a rainbow hanging in the airAnd I thankGod formaking it come trueMakes me think maybe God's a woman tooMakes me think maybe God's a woman tooThere's a full moon tonight And I'm bathing in its lightNaked as the day that I was bornThere is no shame beneath this skyI have kissed the past good-byeAnd mended up my broken heart so tornWith a sweet sound only I can makeAnd it gets stronger with every breath I takeAnd it's all a part of making me feel newMakes me think maybe God's a woman tooMakes me think maybe God's a woman too
