Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night standBut I still need love 'cause I'm just a manThese nights never seem to go to planI don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?Oh, won't you stay with me?'Cause you're all I needThis ain't love it's clear to seeBut darling, stay with meWhy am I so emotional?No it's not a good look, gain some self controlAnd deep down I know this never worksBut you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt Oh, won't you stay with me?'Cause you're all I needThis ain't love it's clear to seeBut darling, stay with meOh, won't you stay with me?'Cause you're all I needThis ain't love it's clear to seeBut darling, stay with meOh, won't you stay with me?'Cause you're all I needThis ain't love it's clear to seeBut darling, stay with me
