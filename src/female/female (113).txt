Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhereLove took over my heart like an ocean breezeAs seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'Love was washed away with the driftin' tideOh it's a dirty old shameWhen all you get from love is a love songThat's got you layin' up nights just waitin' for the music to startIt's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love songBecause the best love songs are written with a broken heartAnd now the tears in my eyes are ever blindingThe future that lies before me I cannot seeAlthough tomorrow I know the sun is risingLighting up the world for everyone, but not for me Oh it's a dirty old shameWhen all you get from love is a love songThat's got you layin' up nights just waitin' for the music to startIt's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love songBecause the best love songs are written with a broken heartOh it's a dirty old shameWhen all you get from love is a love songThat's got you layin' up nights just waitin' for the music to startIt's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love songBecause the best love songs are written with a broken heartOh it's a dirty old shameWhen all you get from love is a love songThat's got you layin' up nights just waitin' for the music to startIt's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love songBecause the best love songs are written with a broken heart
