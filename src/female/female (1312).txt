渴望著 和你的即興演出我一臉酷 但眼神 卻明顯中了毒這勝負 太懸殊期待你表白 卸下迷彩恨心跳太快 來不及耍賴像骨牌 (排山倒海) 你過來 (我不躲閃)吻太壞 (讓我空白) 我側身 (卸下后冠)Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love放逐 毎一吋保守皮膚 臣服 只為你 沒讓出的國度毎一幕 都殘酷這愛的成敗 我想主宰把成見淘汰 別太乖往後看 (全是懸崖) 只能愛 (否則完蛋)這舞台 (人山人海) 你只剩Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love?Why am I born if I can't get your love?越往上爬 越不害怕 故意落下 而你會來 抱住我吧(Why am I born if I can't get your love)越往下沉 越是融化 氧氣缺乏 而你會來 親吻我吧(Why am I born if I can't get your love)
