Where have all the young men gone?Gone to soldiers, every one!When will they ever learn, when will they ever learn?And where have all the soldiers gone, long time passing?Where have all the soldiers gone, a long time ago?Where have all the soldiers gone?Gone to graveyards, every one!When will they ever learn, when will they ever learn?And where have all the graveyards gone, long time passing?Where have all the graveyards gone, long time ago?Where have all the graveyards gone?Gone to flowers, every one!When will they ever learn, oh when will they ever learn?
