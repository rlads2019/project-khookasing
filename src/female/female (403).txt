In the dark I see no wayI was told I must be braveUpon my shoulders there's a flameLooking to the sky my heart is filled with prideReaching out my arms now all my fears subsideThere were times when I was weakLost control of what to believeInto temptation I drove my feetSo unsure of what to do then I found youAnd you carry me together we go through＊On my knees I bend my heart to pray　For your mercy and your grace　To forgive my sins as I go astray　To make me believe let me receive I shall never deceive 　May all glory shine upon you＊There were times when I was weakI Lost control of what to believeInto temptation I drove my feetGrant me the strength along the toughest I learnTo Get out of the shadow and to share what I have earnedREPEAT＊It's the body not the soul that fades when you turn into his graceHe has promised to give all his love to youShed the tears and fears and all disgrace on this glorious dayLift your head and give your hands to himAll the pain from yesterdayWelcome his embrace and you'll be savedOn my knees I now must prayFeel the miracles today
