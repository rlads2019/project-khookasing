flippin' through the channelscan't seem to understandwhy so many childrenare losin' their mums and dadsI remember a time, there would be rainbowsNow we live in a time, with darker skies.There was heavy rainfall down in MississippiPeople lose their familiesto that endless stormI remember days, there would be freedomLet it be today, show the wayIt doesn't matter what colouror whereabouts you areThis world that we have, is for everyoneSo don't you give upWe'll pass the test of timecoz I can't make it throughWithout you.Snowy is the weather, down in ChicagoI guess the world is changin' Even faster than me and youI remember spring, there would be flowersBring me back again, lord won't you please.It doesn't matter what colouror whereabouts you areThis world that we have, is for everyoneSo don't you give upWe'll pass the test of timecoz I can't make it throughWithout you.It doesn't matter what colouror how rich you areThis world that we have, is for everyoneso don't let it downWe'll pass the test of timecoz I can't make it throughWithout you.flippin' through the channelsI see a broken manThrough his devastationHe still smiles through the broken glassCause he knows its time, we are part of somethingSomething beautiful, I see the light.
