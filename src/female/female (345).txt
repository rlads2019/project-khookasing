I will chase, I will reach, I will flyUntil I'm breaking, until I'm breakingOut of my cage, like a bird in the nightI know I'm changing, I know I'm changingIn, into something big, better than beforeAnd if it takes, takes a thousand livesThen It's worth fighting forIts not until you fall that you fly When your dreams come alive you're unstoppableTake a shot, chase the sun, find the beautifulWe will glow in the dark turning dust to goldAnd we'll dream it possibleFrom the bottom to the topWe're sparking wild fire'sNever quit and never stopThe rest of our livesFrom the bottom to the topWe're sparking wild fire'sNever quit and never stopIts not until you fall that you flyWhen your dreams come alive you're unstoppableTake a shot, chase the sun, find the beautifulWe will glow in the dark turning dust to goldAnd we'll dream it possiblewe'll dream it possible
