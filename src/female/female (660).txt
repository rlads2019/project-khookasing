You told me one misty day(that)you'll never go awayThe look in your eyes I'm so afraidDeep in a spell feels like a spinningcarousel Are they just kisses in the windOne day in the morning rain you came back(to)ease my painWill our hearts ever be the same againï¼ŸMake believing there were no broken promisesBut they're just kisses in the windAnd the sun won't ever shine I guess it don't mindNow that you're gone but I will always love you Who'll stop the rain Is it me toblame Broken records and picture framesThe sun setting to the west(I'm)feeling the emptiness or are you saving it all the bestPour out my heart then say we should be(far)apart and they're just kisses in the windThe evening breeze is here say good-bye(I)don't wanna cryOne last kiss my love will never diemay be a fool my neverending love for youTo you it's just kisses in the wind
