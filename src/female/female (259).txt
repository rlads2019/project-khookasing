Why do birds suddenly appearEvery time you are nearJust like me, they long to beClose to youWhy do stars fall down from the skyEvery time you walk byJust like me, they long to beClose to youOn the day that you were bornAnd the angels got togetherAnd decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dustIn your hair of goldAnd starlight in your eyes of blueThat is why all the girls in townFollow you all aroundJust like me, they long to beClose to youJust like me, they long to beClose to you[中譯]靠近你為何每次你靠近的時候鳥兒就突然翔飛起來他們就像我一樣也渴望能靠近你為何每次你經過的時候星星就自天空墜落他們就像我一樣也渴望能靠近你你出生的那一天天使們齊聚決定讓美夢成真她們將月亮的星塵灑落在你的金髮而你的湛藍雙眼裡有星光閃耀所以城裡所有女孩都想要追隨在你身旁她們就像我一樣也渴望能靠近你她們就像我一樣也渴望能與你貼近
