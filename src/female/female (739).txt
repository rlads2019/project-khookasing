Where you are that's where I wanna beAnd through your eyes, all the things I wanna seeAnd in the night,you are my dreamYou're everything to meYou're the love of my lifeAnd the breath in my prayersTake my hand, lead me thereWhat I need is you hereI can't forget when we are oneFrom your lips The Heavens pour outI can't forget when we are oneWith you alone, I am freeEvery day, every night, you aloneYou're the love of my lifeEvery day, every night, you aloneYou're the love of my lifeWe go dancing in the moonlightWith the starlight in your eyesWe go dancing till the sunriseYou and me we're gonna dance, dance, dance
