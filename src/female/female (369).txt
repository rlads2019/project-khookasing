Rising up, you're the sunthat my life seeksYou revive all my hopes,all of my dreamsI don't know what it is,what I'm feelingTell me if it's all real,am I dreamingA mirage painted blueYou're in my dreamsIn a desert within, a prioriTell me, how do I breatheI'm too happyEverything seems so clear,and now I seeHear the oceans roar,and the distant wavesGo beyond the shore,dreaming far awayEvery step I gois a step to youTake my hands now,You are the cause of my EUPHORIAEUPHORIA Take my hands now,You are the cause of my EUPHORIAClose the door now,When I'm with you I'm in utopiaDo you wander,Looking for that dream that disappears too fastDifferent from a wordLike 'fate,'you and IThe pain in your eyes give away that whatYou see is what I seeWon't you please stay in dreamsHear the oceans roar, and the distant wavesGo beyond the shore, dreaming far awayEvery step I go is a step to youTake my hands now,You are the cause of my EUPHORIAEUPHORIATake my hands now,You are the cause of my EUPHORIAAnd even if the ground breaks where we standIf all the world collapses,Hold my handNo matter who defies us,don't let goJust close your eyes don't wake up from this dream
