I'm wondering how I came to be hereLying alone trying hard not to shed a tearRemember daddy said boys don't stay for longThey always think that there's something wrongI open up my eyes and I seeLittle reminders of when you're here with meI'm hooked to the telephonePlease you've got to callI know you never promised anything at all Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cryShanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cryMy last two weeks go by and I stayAll alone in my room with no-one all dayI must realize you will never seeLife could be good if you only stayed with meShanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cryShanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
