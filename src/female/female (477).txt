No more champagne.And the fireworksAre through.Here we areMe and you.Felling lostAnd feeling blue.It's the end of the partyAnd the morning.Seems so greySo unlike.Yesterday Now's the timeFor us to sayHappy new year.Happy new yearMay we all.Have a visionNow and then.Of a world whereEvery neighbour is a friendHappy new year.Happy new yearMay we all.Have our hopesOur will to try.If we don'tWe might as well.Lay down and dieYou and ISometimes I see.How the brave new World arrives.And I seeHow it thrives.In the ashesOf our lives.Oh yes, man is a foolAnd he thinks.He'll be okDragging on.Feet of clayNever knowing.He's astrayKeeps on going.AnywayHappy new year...Seems to me now.That the dreamsWe had before.Are all deadNothing more.Than confettiOn the floor.It's the end of the decadeIn another ten year's timeWho can say.What we'll findWhat lies waiting down the lineIn the end of.Ninty-nineHappy New Year...
