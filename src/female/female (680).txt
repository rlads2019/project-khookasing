I wasn't jealous before we metNow every woman I see is a potential threatAnd I'm possessive, it isn't niceYou've heard me saying that smoking was my only viceBut now it isn't trueNow everything is newAnd all I've learnedHas overturnedI beg of youDon't go wasting your emotionLay all your love on meIt was like shooting a sitting duckA little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuckI still don't know what you've done with meA grown-up woman should never fall so easilyI feel a kind of fearWhen I don't have you nearUnsatisfied I skip my prideI beg you dearDon't go wasting your emotionLay all your love on meDon't go sharing your devotionLay all your love on meI've had a few little love affairsThey didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarceI used to think that was sensibleIt makes the truth even more incomprehensible'Cause everything is newAnd everything is youAnd all I've learnedHas overturnedWhat can I do?Don't go wasting your emotionLay all your love on meDon't go sharing your devotionLay all your love on me
