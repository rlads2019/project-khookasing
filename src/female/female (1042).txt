Isn't it rich, aren't we a pairMe here at last on the ground - and you in mid-airSend in the clownsIsn't it bliss, don't you approveOne who keeps tearing around - and one who can't moveBut where are the clowns - send in the clownsJust when I stopped opening doorsFinally finding the one that I wanted - was yoursMaking my entrance again with my usual flair Sure of my lines - nobody thereDon't you love a farce; my fault I fearI thought that you'd want what I want - sorry my dearBut where are the clowns - send in the clownsDon't bother they're hereIsn't it rich, isn't it queerLosing my timing this late in my careerBut where are the clowns - send in the clownsWell maybe next year
