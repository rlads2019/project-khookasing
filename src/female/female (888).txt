I'll never forgetEverything he saidTrust in me I'll be your manOh babe you won't regretAnd I'll take care of youI'll buy a big house just for twoYou never have to be alone againThat was what he saidTo me after we metLettin my defenses downI chose to take a chanceCos I wanted to believeI've found someone to be dependMy heart will never be broken againTill he walked away Chorus:So from now onI'll carry onLive like we've neverNever loved beforeFrom now onI'll carry onLive like we've never met beforeLive like we've never met beforeThough he didn't stayHis words still remainTo remind I once believeHow good things could've beenBut good things never stayThey're just like a one night standYou wake up in the morningWith a case full of regrets
