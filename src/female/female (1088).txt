You're the first on the list when numbers are glowingAnd the last on their list at the end of your successCos' you should have known betterThat it has always been that way, been that wayYou remember the past The slamming, the screaming of your parentsAnd so you stop believing in loveAnd you think it's okay but it doesn't have to be that way, be that wayI think it's time some things should changeIt doesn't have to be that wayI think it's time some things should changeIt doesn't have to be that way
