I can tell by your eyesThat you're probably being crying foreverAnd the stars in the skyDon't mean nothing to you they are mirrorsI don't wanna talk about itHow you broke my heartIf I stay here just a little bit longer If I stay here won't you listenTo my heart oh my heartIf I stand all alone will be shadowHide the colors of my heart(Blue for the tears black for the nights)Still the stars in the skyDon't mean nothing to you they are mirrors
