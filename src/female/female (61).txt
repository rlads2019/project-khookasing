Play it slow lay it lowYou lead and then I'll followOoh heaven I don't knowWhere art thou my RomeoSing it slowSing it so we can be unfactualDoesn't matter where we goIt's unconditionalWill you still be here tomorrow Catching morning rays in tohoeWill I see you there tomorrowBaby can't you see the love in meIn 2004Will you be loving me moreThrough all that stormy weatherSay foreverFor you I'll do for sureWill you open your doorWill you come catch me when I fallAt the end I hope togetherWe can soar in year 2004
