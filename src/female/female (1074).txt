I am so lonely..My heart is empty But I still try my best to remember you toughlySince a girl like me can never catch your eyesWhen I wake up from my dream then you'll say goodbyeI'm the Sleeping Beauty slept for hundred yearsI'm the Sleeping Beauty waiting you right hereI love you, can't you hear? I can't explain so clear Losing you is all I fearWords can never help to tell I miss you Words can never let you know I'm so blueYes I can never tell you why , I'll just think of you and I.. I then smileI am so lonely..My heart is empty But I still try my best to remember you toughlySince a girl like me can never catch your eye When I wake up from my dream then you'll say goodbyeThere's only your love can wash my tears And I wish I can always stay by thereYou're the one I'm longing for.. You lie within my core Can I dream of you once moreI just wanna hold you close when you lose your soulI gonna tell you now..gonna tell..how my love just seems to grow with timeSleeping Beauty slept for hundred yearsI'm the Sleeping Beauty waiting you right hereI love you, can't you hear? I can't explain so clear Losing you is all I fearThere's only your love can wash my tearsAnd I wish I can always stay by theeYou're the one I'm longing for.. You lie within my coreCan I dream of you once more
