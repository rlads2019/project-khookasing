All I needed was a shoulder to cry onAnd someone to, to say it's okNot that it was hard to try to be strongBut there were moments when I just had to BREAKDOWNOh I've cried, How I've criedTears that you will never see ....Do you know?How it hurts? How it feels to be afraidOf the world?How it feels to be alone?Do you know what it meansWhen you turn and walk away?Do you know?That I'll ALWAYS let you down?All the years of silenceWalls between usAnd anger insideYou'll misunderstand meI'll pay you backIn a way that makes you mad
