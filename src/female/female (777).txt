Don't know and I don't careI'll bet you, you don't dareTake me to somewhere that's coolThe best, you are the bestTime is the greatest testTake me to somewhere with youI say its time toLeave it all behind and find the truthIt's all that's left to doMake my day your wayNo matter what they sayKeep it up, all upNo matter if it's goneIf I can keep my spirit upGuess that I, I could be so strongTogether we can sing for longI guess you'd like this songDon't cry, don't even tryDon't wanna hear you sighTake me to somewhere that's cool The one you are the oneDo it all while we're still youngTake me to somewhere to runI say its time toLeave it all behind and find the truthIt's all that's left to doMake my day your wayNo matter what they sayKeep it up, all upNo matter if it's goneIf I can keep my spirit upGuess that I, I could be so strongTogether we can sing for longI guess you'd like this songMake my day your wayNo matter what they sayKeep it up, all upNo matter if it's goneIf I can keep my spirit upGuess that I, I could be so strongTogether we can sing for longI guess you'd like this song
