Ｓ：Forgive them for they don't know what they do Lord　　And give them the strength to stay trueＳ：Crying everyday, I know I'll never see the day　　When the world is caving and I wonder who'll be saved　　I know that you love me and you know I love you too　　Everybody's letting go but lord I found youＧ：I stay blessed with myself　Cause it's a test when I walk out　　I puff my chest at Life's endless challenges　　I wanna participate and create　　But there's a barricade within me　　Wake up and back to sleep　　Energy depletes　Now I'm feeling' dead like a eulogy　　The duality　Of what's real and what's lies　　I feel the vibes　Of chaos and design　　I got a cup link　And I got it straight pimpin'　　Rock shades at night　Cause my loneliness is blaring　　The only choice I got is fear or love　　Success is to be with the L.O.V.E.　　GeeStyles　I dougie'd a vision　　God shows me a path through intuition　　It's divine decision　It's the moment I'm catching　　If it's a battle for the mind　Then all day I'll be blastingＳ：I've seen it before　I never knew the score　　I'm wide awake and watching as the world explodes　　Forgive them for they don't know what they do Lord　　And give me the strength to stay true Ｊ：Day to day I prayed　Hopin today is a better day　　But watchin so many wasted talent away　　Livin a life of this self-hate　　How do we begin to sin　no win　and no openin　　Kids gettin abused by pills　　Not knowing what's at stake　　Not knowing when their life in one piece will soon break　　Life's too short for this kinna game　　It's not worth it　it's so lame　　At the end of the day　it's no one to blameＤ：I've lived the life I've loved to live　　Taking back all my life I serve to give　　Soldier on all the hate I can't feel the bliss　　Loving from inside I can't feel the kiss　　One life that's all there is　Real life, is where hell begins　　Man killing man　Is the main cause of this　　Fighting for your right is all of kidsＳ：Save me lord　I never meant to be this way　　I'd given up on everything and all I had was pain　　Oh why　why do we play these games　　I'd given up most everything to be with meＳ：I've seen it before　I never knew the score　　I'm wide awake and watching as the world explodes　　Forgive them for they don't know what they do Lord　　And give me the strength to stay trueＳ：I've seen it before　I never knew the score　　I'm wide awake and watching as the world explodes　　Forgive them for they don't know what they do Lord　　And give me the strength to stay true
