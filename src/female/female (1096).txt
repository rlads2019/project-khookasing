I don't wanna lose you,I don't wanna use youjust to have sombody by my sideAnd I don't wanna hate youI don't wanna take youBut I don't wanna be the one to cryThat don't really matter to anyone, anymoreBut like a fool I keep losing my placeAnd I keep seeing you walk through that doorBut there's a danger in loving somebody too muchAnd it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't trust.There's a reason why people don't stay where they areBaby sometimes love just ain't enoughNow I could never change youI don't wanna blame youBaby you don't have to take the fallYes I may have hurt youBut I did not desert youMaybe I just want to have it all It makes a sound like thunderIt makes me feel like rainAnd like a fool who will never see the truthI keep thinking something's gonna changeBut there's a danger in loving somebody too muchAnd its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trustThere's a reason why people don't stay where they areBaby sometimes love just ain't enoughAnd there's no way homewhen it's late at night and you're all aloneAre there things that you wanted to sayDo you feel me beside you in your bedthere beside you where I used to layAnd there's a Danger in loving somebody too muchAnd it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touchThere's a reason why people don't stay who they areCause baby sometimes love just ain't enoughBaby sometimes love just ain't enough[中譯]不願失去你　不願利用你　只願有人長伴我側並不想恨你　不想征服你　只是不想再哭泣不再有所謂　像個傻瓜　我不斷退讓　不停看著你來去愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲人們總是學不乖　寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠既然無法改變你　我也不怪你寶貝你無須承擔這個過錯是的　我也許傷過你　但也從未想要遺棄你也許我太過貪心　貪求迴盪如雷　就像快下起雨一樣像個永遠看不清事實的傻子　滿心相信有些事終究會改變愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲人們總是學不乖　寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠當夜色已晚　而你孤單一人　卻找不到回家的路你有什麼話要說嗎　你可在床邊感到我的陪伴　我曾睡臥的床邊愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲人們總是學不乖　寶貝　因為有時愛就是不足夠寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠
