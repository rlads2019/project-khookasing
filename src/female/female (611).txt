Islands from the first time we sawWe could wait for this moment, like rocks on the shoreWe can never be closer somehowFor the moment that lasts, is this moment now(Chorus)When the night' on fire will you keep the Candlelight BurningHold on to your hearts desireWhen you see one bird into the wind another one's turningAnd the two can fly much higher We are Islands but never too far, we are IslandsAnd I need your light tonight, and I need your light tonightWe are Islands but never too far, we are IslandsAnd I need your light tonight, and I need your light tonightIslands never been to before and we climb so highTo where the wild birds soar, there's a new path thatWe found just today I was lost in the forest and youShowed me the way
