SorrowNow you're gone and I feel sorrowNow you're gone and I feel love, loveMaybe loveSilenceThe room is filled with deadly silenceI'm longing for your touch your voiceI'm longing for your loveIt was (is) love We didn't recognizeWe were prisonersOf conventionsIt was (is) loveAll those silly liesCovering our faceWe will tear them downMomentsThey will return those happy momentsWhen I will feel your touch your smileWhen I'll feel your love
