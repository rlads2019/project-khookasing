Baby, come save meFrom pain and from fearMaybe I'm crazyStill dreaming you are hereNo more tears my babyI cry for youNo more fears, oh maybeI'm missing youLike a hero I will smile againLike a hero in the midnight rainLike a hero I will goMiss you more than you will know When you break my heartLike a hero I will smile againWe're a woman, baby and a manAnd I'm needing your sweet loveGive me more that sweet stuffGive me what you've gotBaby, be with meIt's cold and lonelyOceans of sorrowsA man with no tomorrowNo more tears, my babyI cry for youNo more fears, oh maybeI'm missing you
