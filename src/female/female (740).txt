＊You're always on my mindAll day just all the timeYou're everything to meBrightest star to let me seeYou touch me in my dreamsWe kiss in every sceneI pray to be with youthrough rain and shiny days* ＃I'll love you Till I dieDeep as sea Wide as skyThe beauty of our love paints rainbowsEverywhere we goNeed you all my lifeYou're my hope You're my prideIn your arms I find my heavenIn your eyes my sea and skyMay life be our love paradise＃REPEAT＊＃＃
