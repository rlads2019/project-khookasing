C'est La Vie.Have your leaves all turned to brownWill you scatter them around you.C'est La VieDo you love.And then how am I to knowIf you don't let your love show for me.C'est La VieC'est La Vie,C'est La Vie.Who knows,who cares for meC'est La VieIn the night.Do you light a lover's fireDo the ashes of desire for you remain Like the sea.There's a live too deep to showTook a storm before my live flowed for youC'est La VieLike a song.Out of tune and out of timeAll I needed was a rhymw for youC'est La Vie.Do you giveDo you live from day to dayIs there no song I can play for youC'est La Vie
