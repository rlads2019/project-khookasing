Pardon the way that I stare there's nothing else to compareThe sight of you leaves me weak there are no words left to speakBut if you feel like I feel please let me know that it's realYou're just too good to be true can't take my eyes off youI love you baby, and if it's quite all right I need you baby to warmThe lonely night I love you baby, trust in me when I say:Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray oh pretty baby, Now that I found you stay and let me love you, baby. Let me love you...(**)repeat (*)I love you baby, and if it's quite all right I need you baby to warmThe lonely night I love you baby trust in me when I say:Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray oh pretty baby,Now that I found you stay oh pretty baby.
