I tried to fly awayI tried to find a placeFollowed a shooting starWe fired up the carAnd travelled to afarEverydayWe shared a 'Siamese dream'Beside the schoolyard stairsThe songs we used to loveNo longer good enoughTo keep you from burning upPlease take me back in time with youTo a time when you were trueVisit all seven wondersThere won't be anotherTo keep me satisfiedIf I can fall back into youThere is nothing I can't doIf I'm under the weatherWe talk, I feel betterAt least I knew I hadSomeone who cared Somebody babyI tried to stay awayI tried to give you spaceI couldn't help myselfI only wanted to helpYou pushed my arms awayThen one dayYou walked another wayA place I couldn't stayMy compass fell apartI don't know where to startTo keep this from tearing upPlease take me back in time with youTo a time when you were trueVisit all seven wondersThere won't be anotherTo keep me satisfiedIf I can fall back into youThere is nothing I can't doIf I'm under the weatherWe talk, I feel betterAt least I knew I hadSomeone who caredSomebody baby
