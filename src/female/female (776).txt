Tonight it's been a yearwe met each other hereHere I am all aloneas thoughts of you go onHear me cryin' out to youyou said, 'Never, never would I leave'Here's a tear from me to youand maybe it will make you hear meI loved youYou didn't feel the sameThough we're apartYou're in my heartGive me one more chance toMake it realIn a dream you are hereYou smile and hold me nearAnd in my heart I'll pretend that you are here againHear me cryin' out to youYou said, 'Never, never would I leave'Here's a tear from me to youand maybe it will make you hear meI loved youYou didn't feel the sameThough we're apartYou're in my heartGive me one more chance toMake it realI loved youYou didn't feel the sameThough we're apartYou're in my heartGive me one more chance toMake it realGive me one more chance toMake it real
