Why are there so manySongs about rainbowsAnd what's on the other sideRainbow's are visionsThey're only illusionsAnd rainbows have nothing to hideSo we've been told and some chose toBelieve itBut I know they're wrong wait and seeSomeday we'll find itThe Rainbow ConnectionThe lovers, the dreamers and meWho said that every wishWould be heard and answeredWhen wished on the morning starSomebody thought of thatAnd someone believed itAnd look what it's done so farWhat's so amazingThat keeps us star gazing What so we think we might seeSomeday we'll find itThat Rainbow ConnectionThe lovers the dreamers and meAll of us under it's spellWe know that it's probably magicHave you been half asleepAnd have you heard voicesI've heard them calling my nameAre these the sweet sounds that calledThe young sailorsI think they're one and the sameI've heard it too many times to ignore itThere's something that I'm supposed to beSomeday we'll find itThe Rainbow ConnectionThe lovers, the dreamers and me
