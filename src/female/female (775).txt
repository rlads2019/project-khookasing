We fell in love faster than lighteningBefore we got to knowEach other's storyBut too much honesty then tore us by the seamsWe didn't know how to mend itSo decided to end itThen one day you called me to tell meYou kinda met a real cool ladyBut you're caught in betweenYou don't know how or whyBut you just know you still love meThat you can't forget meOh what a sad tragedyOh why oh whyHas love become so complicated?Was it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time we'll make it for realTime after timeWe would talk it throughThe past was too much for you You took what you couldBut now you've lost the courage to start over newYou're not the man I once knewThings aren't the way they used toSo what now?What can I do about itI love you I still do but where doWe go on from here?It tears me up inside to hear you say you still love meBut you can't be with meWe're stuck in this tragedyOh why oh whyHas love become so complicated?Was it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time we'll make it for realHas love become so complicated?Was it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time we'll make it for real
