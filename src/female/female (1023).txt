I am sailing, I am sailing,　home again 'cross the sea.I am sailing, stormy waters,　to be near you, to be free.航行　航行　我正航向遠方的家鄉橫越大海穿過暴風雨　我正航向妳　航向自由I am flying, I am flying,　like a bird 'cross the sky.I am flying, passing high clouds,　to be with you, to be free.飛行　飛行　如一隻鳥　橫越天空　掠過白雲　我正飛向妳　飛向自由Can you hear me, can you hear me　through the dark night, far away,I am dying, forever crying,　to be with you, who can say.你能聽到我的聲息嗎　你能聽到我的聲息嗎　我的聲音是否很遙遠 我就要死去　永遠的哭泣　但我依然飛向妳Can you hear me, can you hear me,　through the dark night far away.I am dying, forever trying,　to be with you, who can say.We are sailing, we are sailing,　home again 'cross the sea.We are sailing stormy waters,　to be near you, to be free.航行　航行　我們一起航向遠方的家鄉橫越大海　穿過暴風雨　我們一起航行　航行Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free,Oh Lord.
