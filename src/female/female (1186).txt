You were so dark when we metNow you're as light as my deathbedAnd though you speak like a fiendYou just sing like an angelI'm not longing to holdI'm not craving to touch youI'm just blissful to beIn the same space that you're inI don't know why my grace is leavingI don't know what your face is meaningOften enough I bore your aching Hoping to learn that you were fakingI don't know why my trace is leavingI don't know what your face is meaningOften enough you bore my sorrowHoping to catch a tear to borrowI will be heading for your rocksAnd trying to melt down the hardness of your soulOf your soulI was so light when we metNow I'm as dark as your deathbedAnd I will never beIn the same space that you're in
